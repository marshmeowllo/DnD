This, being a halfling paladin, named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage and was drawn towards some dark evil she said was manifesting somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer and hadn't been heard from since.

The party then proceeded to slaughter it, final blow dealt by Scanlan via lightning bolt.",IC

And someone starts, ""That was great, that was well done! Fantastic! Where'd you learn that?"" One of them comes up there, ""Ah, I could've done better than that.""
