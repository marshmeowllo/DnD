He sets it up on the ground with a small stand at the front and preps itself with a visual point.",True
1628,Ogre.,True
1629,Ogre back here?,True

1641,"Yeah, that should critical for you.",True
1642,"That does critical for me.
I've never criticaled with this either.
What does that mean?",True

Roll for damage, double that, and add your modifier after that.",True
1644,"Come on!
Big money, no whammies.
Yeah!
Hell yeah!",True
1645,(counting) 27 points of damage.,True
1646,"Get after it, big man!",True
1647,Is that doubled?,True
1648,That's doubled.,True
1649,"You guys hear this cacophonous, large blasting sound, a flash of blue energy and sparks shoot out the back of the weapon.
It actually lifts Percy off the ground for a second and he shifts himself from the sheer blast.
This streaking, heated bullet, reddish, white hot, goes cascading through the air, plunges into the side of the ogre's shoulder with a smattering of blood splattering against the cave behind it.
It's actually moved back a step and has to catch itself.
Slams its club into the ground.
That ends your turn?",True
1650,"I can't do anything after that.
That's just reload.",True
1651,"Tiberius, you're up.",True
1652,I move within 60 feet of those big fellows.,True

1657,Right before there.,True
1658,"Everything there is fighting from the entanglement.
Most of these goblins are currently inside of it.",True
1659,I'm going to shoot a Scorching Ray at the big guy.,True
1660,Both of them?,True
1661,He said he moved within 60 feet of them.,True
1662,"You moved up to here?
All righty.",True
1663,"They're all entangled, yeah?",True
1664,That's good right there.,True
1665,Still have Entagle up.,True
1666,"These guys here are entangled.
These front goblins are not.
Scorching Ray you said at which ones?",True
1667,"Actually, oh there's a bunch of those dudes, aren't there?
I'm going to do a Fireball instead, right in the center of the juiciness where I can get a couple little guys and both the big guys.",True
1668,"All right, so I'd probably about there would be where you'd want it.",True
1669,"I'm going to do that, and I'm going to spend two sorcerer points immediately to do quickening spell and do another spell right after that.",True
1670,"Okay.
As you rush up, you pull back your hand and you see the arcane red energy begin to flow in your palm.
You then throw the beam out, and it arcs, slams into the center, and explodes hitting each of these five goblins and the two ogres.
What's your DC on your spell?",True
1671,My DC on my spell is--,True
1672,Top of your spell page on the right.,True
1673,"Oh!
Wait.
Oh!
17, sorry.",True
1674,"17, okay.
Wow!
The two ogres actually make their saving throws.",True

1679,"The goblins, however, all disintegrate.",True
1680,All of them?,True
1681,"There's no way they're going to survive the damage you-- they (poofing).
You see this hint of a red ash mist go, (squeaking) where they once were, and they are all turned to black nothingness.
However, roll damage for the ogres.
They get half damage because they made their reflex save.
So 8d6 damage.",True
1682,8d6.,True
1683,(counting) 27!,True
1684,What?!,True
1685,"27, so half that.
As the blast of fire dissipates, you can see one of the ogres is now burnt on half of its chest.
Looking a little rough.
There's blood streaking down from the side of his face where the shrapnel got thrown at him.
The other ogre's looking okay.",True
1686,He's a large creature isn't he?,True
1687,Yes.,True
1688,I'm going to use my second spell and do Telekinesis and pick one up and try to hurl him into the other one.,True
1689,"Okay.
Which one?
The one left here?",True
1690,The one that's beaten up already.,True
1691,I'm hard right now!,True
1692,"He does fail his saving throw.
You lift him up in the air and throw him into that.
That ogre is knocked prone by the impact.",True
1693,Yeah!,True
1694,"The other one is also knocked prone.
Before (splatting) into the wall, both of them slam to the ground.",True
1695,"With my vines, I make sure my vines really grapple him.",True
1696,"I turn to Grog  They're all yours, buddy!",True
1697,Go ahead and roll 2d6 impact damage for the force of the throw.,True
1698,"Sweet!
Impact damage?
Ten.",True
1699,Ten damage to each of them?,True
1700,Yeah.,True
1701,"All right.
Both of the ogres are now on the ground reeling from the impact.
That brings us to Grog and Vex going simultaneously.",True
1702,Ladies first.,True
1703,"Oh!
Well, all right.
I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the most damaged one.",True
1704,"Okay, that'd be this one here.",True
1705,"All right.
Then I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow.",True
1706,"All right.
Do you want to move a little closer?",True
1707,"Yes, I do.",True
1708,"All right.
That would put you right there.",True
1709,"All right, cool.
I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow at them.",True
1710,"Okay.
You pull out your arrow and as you pull it back, a little bit of energy courses through your fingers, strikes through your arrow.
You can now see this crackling energy as you're pulling it taut in your bow.
You let it loose, roll for attack.",True
1711,"Okay!
21!",True
1712,21 hits.,True
1713,"All right.
Then I do something else.
1d8.
Right?",True
1714,"Yep.
You do the damage of the arrow plus the damage of the spell.",True
1715,"Holy moly!
So that's this.
13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell.
(counting) 17!",True
1716,"17.
Okay.
The ogre that's been beaten, blasted by the fireball, it's getting up-- (grunt).
It grabs its club, and it begins to get up on one leg as the Lightning Arrow slams into its chest.
You can see it hits.
Looks down for a second, and then the charge pulses through its entire torso.
As it does, it screams out, ""Ugh!"" into the cavern, its whole muscle system locks tight and it falls forward again, onto its chest, smoke rising off of its whole upper area, unmoving, on the ground.
He is gone.",True
1717,"Dang!
Come on now!",True
1718,"Yes!
Then the other one takes 2d8 if he fails his saving throw.",True
1719,"Which, with a one, he does.",True
1720,"Yes!
Oh, he fails it so good.",True
1721,Go ahead a roll damage for other ogre.,True
1722,"Two.
ten.",True
1723,"Ten damage.
Nice.
As he falls to the ground, the arc arcs over to the other one who drops his club for a second.
Picks it up angrily.",True
1724,I can reassign my Hunter's Mark to him now?,True
1725,You can.,True
1726,Yes.,True
1727,"Yes, all right.
That brings us to--",True
1728,"Oh, my Hunter's Mark!
I didn't do my Hunter's Mark damage.
But it doesn't matter.
He's dead.",True
1729,"It doesn't matter.
You killed him.",True
1730,"All right, cool.",True
1731,"You just ultra killed him!
(valley girl voice) He is so dead.
Oh my god.
This ogre is done.
(normal voice) All right.
The other ogre's angry.
It's now the goblins' turn.
These goblins rush up.
They are dashing forward.",True
1732,(valley girl voice) They are so dead.,True
1733,"(valley girl voice) They're just, like, dead.
This one moves around, and this one runs around to there.
No attacks.
Everyone make an insight check.",True
1734,"Insight check?
Oh shit.",True
1735,"What happened?
Why are we doing this?",True
1736,I literally get a one.,True
1737,"(sings) Natural 20!
On an insight check.",True
1738,"20 total.
20.",True
1739,22.,True
1740,Four.,True
1741,"Natural one.
I'm really not paying attention.",True
1742,"You're dealing with the fact that you just fired your gun for the first time and it burned your hands a little.
You're like ""Ugh!""",True
1743,Grog.,True
1744,Recites poetry.,True
1745,"Grog is familiar with one thing, fear in the eyes of his enemies.
Looking at these goblins, they're not charging to attack.
The attacks seem to be instinctual.
They are running.",True
1746,"Oh, no!",True
1747,They are scared.,True
1748,Yes!,True
1749,They are fleeing from something.,True
1750,From the ogres?,True
1751,Something behind the ogres.,True
1752,"Oh, no.",True
1753,May I make a request that you kill them anyway?,True
1754,"It's like playing croquet at this point, so yes.
(laughter)",True
1755,"Grog, it's your turn.",True
1756,"I would like to rage!
And I would like to move to the right of all those stinking goblins!",True
1757,Right over here?,True
1758,"Yeah, a little more to the right.
Yeah, a little more.
Yeah, keep going.
All the way flanking it there.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then I would like to give them the cleanest shave possible with my greataxe.",True
1759,"All right.
Go ahead and roll for attack on the first one.",True
1760,"18 plus eight.
That's 26?",True
1761,"That definitively hits.
Go ahead and roll damage.",True
1762,"Oh, damage, crap.",True
1763,(sings) Decapitation!,True
1764,"Two plus the four.
13!",True
1765,"13?
Okay.
As you rush up, you bring your axe into the first goblin to your right (whoosh) clean.
You don't even feel resistance.
You hear this little (wheeze) sound as this being is bisected.",True
1766,"Oh, that was cute.",True
1767,"Its head and upper torso rolling off to the side before rolling to a stop.
However, the inertia of your axe still keeps through to the one on the other side of you.
Go ahead and roll for your second attack on that.",True
1768,21!,True
1769,"Also hits, go ahead and roll damage.",True
1770,"Oh, that was eight plus seven is 15!",True
1771,"As you cleave through the first goblin, you swing around, another goblin looks up at you, scared, and pulls a dagger out with its gnarled tongue, (hisses), at which point the axe embeds itself straight into its face.
Its angry face goes, ""Ugh!"" and falls slack against your blade.
You lift backward, and it's stuck to the edge of your axe.
Just limply dangling against-- you shake it off a little bit.",True
1772,"Double prizes!
Yeah!",True
1773,"Great.
That ends your turn.
The thing about rage is that you can use your bonus action for a third attack.
If you wanted to do a frenzy action, but you don't need to.
That brings us to the ogre's turn.
The ogre gets up, let's see if it makes its saving throw for an attempt to get out.
It does with an 18.
However, the ogre gets about that far.
It's going to make a double move.",True
1774,Double move?!,True
1775,He's running.,True
1776,I still have Entangle up.,True
1777,"I know.
He managed to resist it.",True
1778,He saved against it.,True
1779,It's a big ogre.,True
1780,Poop.,True
1781,"The ogre takes his full turn to get up in melee with you guys.
It does not have its attack since it used its full movement there.
Once again, you see as it's lumbering forward, it also has this look in its eye of desperation.",True
1782,Oh crap.,True
1783,We should just let it pass.,True
1784,Now it is Vax's go.,True
1785,"My sister's right in the face of the ogre, correct?",True
1786,Correct.,True
1787,"Excellent.
I'm going to take a run towards my sister, since she's right close to him, he's distracted so I'm going to turn just as I get to her, so my back presses against hers and swing around and sneak attack two daggers up in his belly.",True
1788,"We've practiced this, I turn.",True
1789,"All right.
As you dodge to the side, this blur of shadow and speed, you coast up to the side of your sister, dagger both plunge towards the side of the ogre.
Go ahead and roll for an attack.",True
1790,"All right.
One.
Then the other one I do a poison dagger, gets a (singing) 20!",True
1791,"Oh, put it on him brother!",True
1792,All right.,True
1793,"That is dagger of venom, 1d4.
Three, plus two is five, and then is the sneak attack damage go with--?",True
1794,"Yeah it does because you have another ally adjacent to it.
You don't get advantage on the attack roll, but you can still do the sneak attack.",True
1795,"Critical hit, too, as well, wouldn't it?",True
1796,"Yeah!
You can multiply the sneak attack damage.",True
1797,"Five, plus- and the double goes to the sneak attack damage?",True
1798,"It does.
Modifiers don't double, but any dice you roll double.",True
1799,"Nine, 15--",True
1800,"In my game.
(clicks tongue)",True
1801,"So 30 plus five, 35.",True
1802,35 damage.,True
1803,Plus poison.,True
1804,"The poison's not going to factor in.
You swing past her, both blades jam right into the side of its rib cage.
You hear it howl out in pain.
As it does, you twist the daggers in a way where both blades are now going in two different directions, and you carve out a section of its entire abdomen.
As you do, the flesh, like whale blubber, sloughs off the sides of it.
Organs spill out, intestines, and it looks down and tries to pull them back in.
You see the color draining from its face, and you lean up and kick it down.
The ogre and falls to the ground lifeless, destroyed.",True
1805,You gave him just enough time to regret everything that had ever happened.,True
1806,Yes.,True
1807,"Well done.
Bad life choices.",True
1808,That brings us to Keyleth.,True
1809,I didn't call my mom enough.,True
1810,There are two goblins left?,True
1811,There are two goblins left.,True
1812,"Okay.
I do a quick sprint jog up up towards Grog and go (boof) and bring up a big stone wall.
Right where that entrance is.",True
1813,Right here?,True
1814,"No.
Like, right where things are pouring out.",True
1815,"Right, here?",True
1816,Yeah.,True
1817,"All right, Wall of Stone.",True
1818,Wall of Stone-- boom.,True
1819,"All right.
A giant wall of stone now completely seals off that part of the mine.",True
1820,"We don't know what's in there, we should talk about this for a second, and I bought us some time.
I'm sure it's going to try to beat through that door in a second.",True
1821,"I'm going to say that you moved up to there with your movement.
All right, I'd say probably over here, not right next to the goblins and that will give you enough range.
Okay, so the wall of stone-- (boom)",True
1822,"Are there any guards around still?
Any dwarven guards?",True
1823,"They are all watching you do this now.
They don't want to put their lives at risk, and you guys seem intent on getting into the middle of this battle, so they are going to sit back and let you do it.",True
1824,"I throw up my wall and turn around and I say: What's coming?!
Tell us!
You know what's coming.
What's coming?!",True
1825,Make an intimidation check.,True
1826,"Keyleth, you are so hardcore.",True
1827,I'm not good at this.,True
1828,You speak goblin?,True
1829,"Oh, four.
(laughter and groaning)",True
1830,(tearfully) What's coming?,True
1831,Make a pity roll.,True
1832,"A very gentle attempt at intimidation, however, the message gets across.
The guards look at you, taken off guard.",True

It is in your best interest to tell us.",True

It's been different things.
Strange abominations.
It's hard to describe.
They're put together.
Something's making things down there.""",True

From where?",True

1838,I bring out my blade.,True
1839,"The stone cracks, and you can see a noticeable crack and an audible (cracking).",True
1840,I'm running right now diagonally towards the wall and I press against the wall.,True
1841,"Oh, good call.
I do the same thing on the other side.",True
1842,"Okay, so you come over here.
Do you want to bring Trinket with you?",True
1843,Yeah!,True
1844,All right.,True
1845,You're all so fancy.,True
1846,I cast Stoneskin on myself.,True

I mean the ceiling.",True

1851,Hundreds.,True
1852,"Yeah, it is a huge ceiling.",True

Are those fires?",True
1854,"These are braziers here.
By the way, Stoneskin goes, this disappears.",True
1855,The entanglement?,True
1856,"Yeah, the entanglement is gone.
There are minecarts, some rocks, there is a smashed cart over here from when the ogre barreled through.
This is a piece of stone that rises about 15 feet, and these are both braziers for light in the center of the area.
Yeah, it's hundreds and hundreds of feet up.
You can look up to the very top of Kraghammer from here.",True
1857,"Okay, that's fine.",True
1858,"Whatcha got?
Well, let's see.
Keyleth, that's your turn, Stoneskin and moving up.
Anywhere else you want to go?
Right now, we're technically not in combat.",True

We're out of combat.",True

Both of these goblins-- I'll just say that you guys end up taking them down.
It's not even a question.
You step on them and crush them.",False

Balgus.",False
1869,"Balgus?
You tell them, ""Get Balgus!"" and they're like, ""Who?"" Some of them have set crossbows up by the way.
They're barreling down to get ready to fire at whatever comes through.
(impact) Another crack in the wall.
You can see the dust settle as the stone cracks again and a large piece at the top tumbles off.
The stone wall's probably not going to hold another impact.
Anybody else want to move anywhere?",False
1870,Just taking aim.,False

Now?",False

Just give them a dice.",False

If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw.
A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale.
(record scratching) Wait.
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale.
In his early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe, Grog oft enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd, but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, (chuckles) this terrified little thing.
His disobedience cost him dearly.
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die.
Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him.
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.
And they have remained close friends ever since.
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches, ha!
Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors, huh.

You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet.
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions.
(lightning roaring) Under that unintimidating, petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally.
(giggles) Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics.
It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begins to bleed with this realm.
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beastshaping abilities.
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts, which I do.
(clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations.
Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters.
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself.
Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return.
As she hikes down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader.

With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

During a feast held in their honour, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell.

Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you.

Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother.
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known, the true love of a fellow gnome.
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third.
On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike.

2166,"Greetings and salutations.
I am Tiberius Stormwind.
I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, from a politically respected family.
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic.
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history.
For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring.
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world.
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend.
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye.
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.
I found those answers to be unacceptable.
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.
Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia.
Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there.
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that.
(mutters) I am much sharper than most give me credit for.
I just don't pay attention to things sometimes.
I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.
I can't help but show my true scales every now and then.
But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.",False
2167,"Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door.
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry.
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn.
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last.
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road.
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth.
But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble.
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.
Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(loud roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely.
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (sword slicing) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.",False
2168,"Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other.
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador.
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own.
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods.
She preferred the isolation.
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.
And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen trinket, (bear growling) to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.
Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages.
Welcome back everyone.
So, know that you're a little more affiliated with the characters, let's get this party started.
So as a head's up, I wanna let you know, once again, we're waiting for the charity elements of this stream to open up again, since the big charity that happened a couple weeks ago.
Once we do, we're gonna be taking donations, half to go to help run the channel, the other to donate to 826.
Marisha will explain that here in just a second.
As a head's up, Ashley, who plays our cleric, Pike, unfortunately couldn't make it again this week, because she's busy filming amazing stuff with her career being amazing.
But she says she's sad she can't be here.
She loves you guys, and as soon as Pike can re-enter the campaign, hopefully in a couple weeks, all awesome gnomeness shall double.
So also tonight, there was a goal to try and hit 1000 subscribers on the channel.
So what we're gonna do is, we only have 130 people to subscribe tonight.
If we can get all 130 before the show ends this evening, we're gonna do a random selection of a person within those thousand subscribers to win a copy of the Player's Handbook signed by all of us, as well as a really, really cool image that was tweeted out earlier by Geek & Sundry, also signed by all of us.
So, go ahead and pull your friends, see if we can get some more subscribers before the show's out tonight, so hopefully that'll be fun.
So, Marisha, if you wanna go ahead and explain a little bit about the charity 826 we'll be plugging in the near future.
Yes, 826 LA is a non-profit charity organization that helps kids though the age of six to 18 with their creative and structural writing skills, and they also help teachers and yeah.
Good artsy creative things.
So donate, and definitely visit the Time Travel Mart.",False

2171,We can't donate tonight yet?,False

Start saving your money.",False

2175,"Yes, but we'll be getting that going in the near future.
So, anyway.
Let's go ahead and do a little recap of what happened last week.
So the party has been hired by their friend, Arcanist Allura Vysoren, in the city of Emon to head towards the dwarven town of Kraghammer, as a good friend of hers, and one of the members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, has gone missing.
This, being a halfling paladin, named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage and was drawn towards some dark evil she said was manifesting somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer and hadn't been heard from since.
So the party was sent there to go ahead and seek her.
Upon arriving in Kraghammer, shenanigans ensued.
They made some friends, made some enemies, wandered the town.
Brother, sisters, walked around as if they were married.",False
2176,"No!
(group laughs)",False

And eventually the party made their way towards the bottom ring of Kraghammer proper, talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who is--",False
2178,"That's right, Greyspine.",False
2179,"Yes, Greyspine indeed.
Who is the head of the Greyspine Mines at the bottom of Kraghammer, where supposedly this paladin disappeared to.
After having a conversation with him, a bunch of goblins and ogres began to spring from the mines and attacking the workers.
The party swooped down to aid, realized that the goblins and ogre's weren't attacking, they were fleeing from something else, of which emerging from within the mines proper some strange naga-based hydra-ish abomination.
The party then proceeded to slaughter it, final blow dealt by Scanlan via lightning bolt.",False
2180,"Hi, Scanlan here, hi.",False
2181,Our resident gnome bard.,False
2182,"Yeah, you did!",False
2183,"And that's where we pick up.
So, as all of you are still riding the adrenaline of the battle, Scanlan feeling the tingling in his fingers as the little bolts of arcane energy kind of (imitates electricity crackling) spark throughout, the rest of the nearby workers and miners slowly converge in and begin to walk up to the party.
And someone starts, ""That was great, that was well done!
Fantastic!
Where'd you learn that?"" One of them comes up there, ""Ah, I could've done better than that."" And they start just shouting off at each other and pat each other on the back.
A few moments of this progresses before, all of a sudden, there's a hush comes about the crowd, and you see about five or six Carvers pull their way through, Carvers being the guards of Kraghammer, with Lord Nostoc Greyspine himself stepping through.
He looks at the rest of the group and goes, ""All right, so you've certainly proven yourselves in battle.""",False
2184,"Well, of course we have.
I'm sorry.",False
2185,"""I would like to continue this conversation that we had back in my office if you don't mind."" He turns around and begins to walk back.",False
2186,"Oh wait, Nostoc.
He's not even listening, he's just walking off.
(group laughs) Yeah, mmm.
Ooh, shall we turn and follow?",False
2187,"Are you still an eagle?
Can you even talk to him?",False
2188,Shouldn't you just go caw?,False

2191,"Oh, that'd be great.",False
2192,Yeah!,False
2193,"Hold on, I'm gonna go up, and I'm gonna cast--",False
2194,"Cast?
Yeah, I can cast spells.",False
2195,You can cast?,False
2196,"I can.
I've got plenty o' spells.",False
2197,You can kill?,False
2198,"All right, fair enough.",False
2199,I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth.,False

Essentially go ahead and make a saving throw with advantage.
This'll be Constitution.",False
2201,I made the second one.,False
2202,What'd you roll?,False
2203,"A 10.
Plus my constitution which is two, three, thirteen.",False
2204,So thirteen?,False
2205,Yes.,False
2206,"That'd be enough.
So, after you finish casting the spell, you feel the poison leave the rest of your body.
You can kind of take a breath to yourself.

Talk to him?""",False

2213,You promise?,False

We need to take care of business.
Let's go talk to the man.
I'm sure it's going to lead back to the mines.",False
2215,To the hole.,False
2216,"Yes, to the hole.
Everything's back to the hole.",False
2217,"Percy, do you have something to say before we go?",False
2218,"Well, this is good.
We have to find out what that was, and we have to see if he'll finally give us some of that ale, I think are the two most important things.",False
2219,"It was wine, I believe.",False

2228,"All right, so as you head back to the ramp that heads up from the mine enclosure itself to the top of the realm, which is where the Greyspine Industries mining facility is, you are brought into the building again, brought back to Nostoc's office, in which he's not sitting, he's kind of pacing behind his desk, waiting for you as you approach.
As you enter the room, he stops pacing, turns around, puts his hand on the desk, and says, Please, enter and close the doors behind you.

We can handle our own business just fine.""",False

You see these small intrusions have been bad for meeting our quotas with the Bronzegrip metal warehouse and export shipments.
Employees have been forced to collapse a non-negotiable portion of our tunnels to prevent incursions like this.
Without my approval.
And this is a pattern I wish to stop at once.
Thus, I have a proposition for you.
Now, I will give you free reign to our mines.
I shall get the proper approvals to make sure no Carvers bother you as you wander the city's lower ring.
And I will contract you to delve past our tunnels and investigate the source of these creatures, where they come from, where they live, and if there is some sort of a leader who gives them their commands.
Eliminate them.
For this, I will reward you with not a trifle sum.

Plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning.""",False

More of the same?
Or other creatures?",False
