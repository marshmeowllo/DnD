extracted_v1 notes (14/4/25)

- 'in_combat' is really bad for now , please consider not the use

- 'IC_OOC' is okay but not 100% correct , but it is usable

- other casters columns are implemented according to the fandom website.

### please use only the campaign_1 ( the fileID of C1XXX ) as the casts and role for the second campaign may vary. ###
