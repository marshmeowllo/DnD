### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 30)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a cleric. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

#### Additional Cleric Spells[]

*1st-level cleric feature*

The spells in the following list expand the cleric spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Save | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd | Aura of Vitality | Evocation | 1 action | V |  |  | Yes | PHB 216 |
| 3rd | Spirit Shroud | Necromancy | 1 bonus action | V, S |  |  | Yes | TCE 108 |
| 4th | Aura of Life | Abjuration | 1 action | V |  |  | Yes | PHB 216 |
| 4th | Aura of Purity | Abjuration | 1 action | V |  |  | Yes | PHB 216 |
| 5th | Summon Celestial | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 500gp |  | Yes | TCE 110 |
| 6th | Sunbeam | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution | Yes | PHB 279 |
| 8th | Sunburst | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution |  | PHB 279 |
| 9th | Power Word Heal | Evocation | 1 action | V, S |  |  |  | PHB 266 |

#### Harness Divine Power[]

*2nd-level cleric feature*

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on your level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Cantrip Versatility[]

*4th-level cleric feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.

#### Blessed Strikes[]

*8th-level cleric feature, which replaces the Divine Strike or Potent Spellcasting feature*

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature.

Once you deal this damage you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per cleric level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per cleric level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

### Equipment[]

* (a) a mace, or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)
* (a) scale mail, or (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)
* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts, or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) priest's pack, or (b) an explorer's pack
* A shield and a holy symbol

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Spellcasting[]

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

### Cantrips[]

You know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 4th cantrip at 4th level and a 5th at 10th level.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

## Divine Domain[]

Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

* Ambition Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 27)
* Arcana Domain (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 125)
* Death Domain (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 96)
* Forge Domain (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 18)
* Grave Domain (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 19)
* Knowledge Domain (Player's Handbook, page 59)
* Life Domain (Player's Handbook, page 60)
* Light Domain (Player's Handbook, page 60)
* Nature Domain (Player's Handbook, page 61)
* Order Domain (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 31; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 25)
* Peace Domain (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 33)
* Solidarity Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 24)
* Strength Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 25)
* Tempest Domain (Player's Handbook, page 62)

* Twilight Domain (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 34)
* War Domain (Player's Handbook, page 63)
* Zeal Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 28)

### Domain Spells[]

Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Channel Divinity[]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Turn Undead[]

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Destroy Undead[]

Starting at 5th level, when an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed. The CR of undead increases as you gain levels.

| Cleric level | Destroys undead of CR... |
| --- | --- |
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |

## Divine Intervention[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Ambition Domain[]

(Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 27)

### Ambition Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Bane, Disguise Self |
| 3rd | Mirror Image, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5th | Bestow Curse, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Death Ward, Dimension Door |
| 9th | Dominate Person, Modify Memory |

### Warding Flare[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

### Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows[]

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Improved Duplicity[]

At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.

## Arcana Domain[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 125)

### Arcana Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Detect Magic, Magic Missile |
| 3rd | Magic Weapon, Nystul's Magic Aura |
| 5th | Dispel Magic, Magic Circle |
| 7th | Arcane Eye, Leomund's Secret Chest |
| 9th | Planar Binding, Teleportation Circle |

### Arcane Initiate[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

### Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, then the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the Banishment spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin, and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown below.

| Cleric Level | Banishes Creature of CR... |
| --- | --- |
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |

### Spell Breaker[]

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Arcane Mastery[]

At 17th level, you choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.

## Death Domain[]

(Dungeon Master's Guide, page 96)

### Death Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | False Life, Ray of Sickness |
| 3rd | Blindness/Deafness, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5th | Animate Dead, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Blight, Death Ward |
| 9th | Antilife Shell, Cloudkill |

### Bonus Proficiency[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

### Reaper[]

At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

### Channel Divinity: Touch of Death[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch.

When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your cleric level.

### Inescapable Destruction[]

Starting at 6th level, your ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignore resistance to necrotic damage.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Improved Reaper[]

Starting at 17th level, when you cast a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th-level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for each target.

## Forge Domain[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 18)

### Forge Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Identify, Searing Smite |
| 3rd | Heat Metal, Magic Weapon |
| 5th | Elemental Weapon, Protection From Energy |
| 7th | Fabricate, Wall of Fire |
| 9th | Animate Objects, Creation |

### Bonus Proficiency[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools.

### Blessing of the Forge[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, "Equipment," in the Player's Handbook for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

### Eyes of the Grave[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature's life force for termination.

As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.

### Sentinel at Death's Door[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death's progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.

If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the Suggestion spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

* **Object Reading:** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.
* **Area Reading:** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent.

However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Guided Strike[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing[]

At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Avatar of Battle[]

At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

### Channel Divinity: Consuming Fervor[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to channel your zeal into unchecked ferocity.

When you roll fire or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

### Resounding Strike[]

At 6th level, when you deal thunder damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Blaze of Glory[]

Starting at 17th level, you can delay death for an instant to perform a final heroic act.

When you are reduced to 0 hit points by an attacker you can see, even if you would be killed outright, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker and make one melee weapon attack against it, as long as the movement brings it within your reach. You make this attack with advantage. If the attack hits, the creature takes an extra 5d10 fire damage and an extra 5d10 damage of the weapon's type. You then fall unconscious and begin making death saving throws as normal, or you die if the damage you took would have killed you outright.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Modern Magic[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic])

## City Domain[]

The City domain is concerned with the citizenry, commerce, traffic, and even architecture of modern civilization. In the eyes of a cleric of the city, the center of modern life is a sense and spirit of community, and the gravest enemies of the city are those who seek to harm the common weal of its citizens.

### City Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Comprehend Languages, Remote Access |
| 3rd | Find Vehicle, Heat Metal |
| 5th | Lightning Bolt, Protection From Ballistics |
| 7th | Locate Creature, Synchronicity |
| 9th | Commune With City, Shutdown |

### Bonus Cantrip[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the On/Off cantrip in addition to your chosen cantrips.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

Also starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with sidearms and proficiency with vehicles (land).

### Heart of the City[]

From 1st level, you are able to tap into the spirit of community found in the city. While you are within any city, you can gain advantage on a single Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check, and you are considered proficient in the appropriate skill. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Spirits of the City[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call on the city for aid. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any city utility within 30 feet of you either works perfectly or shuts down entirely for 1 minute (your choice).

Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone or restrained (your choice) by hazards such as entangling wires, high-pressure water erupting from fire hydrants, pavement collapsing to unseen potholes, and so on. A restrained creature can escape by making a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.

This effect is entirely local and affects only utilities within 30 feet of you. Determination of what utilities are available within range and how the physical effects of those utilities manifest are left to the DM.

### Block Watch[]

Starting at 6th level, your awareness while in the city extends preternaturally. While in an urban environment, you are considered proficient in the Insight and Perception skills, and you add double your proficiency bonus to Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with psychic energy borrowed from the citizens of your city. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra psychic damage increases to 2d8.

### Express Transit[]

At 17th level, you can use mass transit routes to transport instantaneously to other points in the city. Starting from a bus stop, train station, subway stop, or other suitable mass transit site within the city, you can teleport to any other similar transit stop within the city, as if you had cast a teleport spell whose destination is a permanent Teleportation Circle you know. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.

# Wonders of the Multiverse[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Wonders of the Multiverse])

## Fate Domain[]

Gods of fate perceive the future and how the choices mortals make drive them toward their destinies. Some deities consider the future preordained, while others understand the multiverse as a place of infinite possibility. Clerics who draw power from the forces of fate sometimes receive visions directly from their deity and receive fleeting omens of the future. They share impossible knowledge with their allies and prophesize their enemies' doom.

### Fate Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Dissonant Whispers, Heroism |
| 3rd | See Invisibility, Warding Bond |
| 5th | Beacon of Hope, Clairvoyance |
| 7th | Death Ward, Divination |
| 9th | Commune, Geas |

### Omens and Portents[]

At 1st level, you can perceive signs of the future in everyday objects and events, such as flights of birds or ripples made in water by a thrown stone. You can cast the Augury spell without expending a spell slot and, when you cast the spell in this way, the spell has no verbal, somatic, or material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

In addition, until you finish a long rest, when you cast a divination spell that includes a chance the DM gives you no answer or a random reading — such as Augury, Commune, or Divination — reduce that chance by 25 percent.

### Ties That Bind[]

At 1st level, you can temporarily tie your fate to others. As an action, you can touch one object or creature and magically tie a strand of fate from yourself to it for 1 hour or until you use this feature again. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to resist this effect. While the target is bound to you and on the same plane of existence as you, you can sense the direction to the target's location, and you know the direction of its movement if it is in motion.

In addition, once per turn when you cast a spell using a spell slot to deal damage or restore hit points to the target, roll a d6, and the target receives extra damage or healing, respectively, equal to the number rolled.

You can use this feature's action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Strands of Fate[]

At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to see and manipulate the strands of fate that weave around other individuals. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for up to 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever another creature you can see makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can use a reaction to give the roll advantage or disadvantage (your choice).

### Insightful Striking[]

At 6th level, as a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Your magic grants you a brief vision of the target's defenses. Until the end of your next turn, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:

* The next time you make an attack roll against the target, roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.
* The next time the target must make a saving throw against a spell you cast, the target must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the saving throw.

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Visions of the Future[]

At 17th level, your knowledge of the future allows you to guide an individual to achieve their greatest possible success. You can cast the Foresight spell once without expending a spell slot; when you cast the spell in this way, the spell's duration is 1 minute for that casting. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Divine Domains[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Divine Domains])

## Protection Domain[]

The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods' faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind. Deities who grant this domain include Helm, Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Paladine, Dol Dorn, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Yondalla, Athena, and Odin.

### Protection Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Compelled Duel, Protection From Evil and Good |
| 3rd | Aid, Protection From Poison |
| 5th | Protection From Energy, Slow |
| 7th | Guardian of Faith, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere |
| 9th | Antilife Shell, Wall of Force |

### Bonus Proficiency[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Shield of the Faithful[]

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to hinder attacks intended for others. When a creature attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. To do so, you must be able to see both the attacker and the target. You interpose an arm, a shield, or some other part of yourself to try to throw the attack off target.

### Channel Divinity: Radiant Defense[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cloak your allies in radiant armor.

As an action, you channel blessed energy into an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you. The first time that ally is hit by an attack within the next minute, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level.

### Blessed Healer[]

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others can heal you as well. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and it restores hit points to any creature other than you this turn, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Indomitable Defense[]

At 17th level, you gain resistance to two damage types of your choice, choosing from bludgeoning, necrotic, piercing, radiant, and slashing. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can change the damage types you chose.

As an action, you can temporarily give up this resistance and transfer it to one creature you touch. The creature keeps the resistance until the end of your next short or long rest or until you transfer it back to yourself as a bonus action.
