# Equipment

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/2/2f/Equipment.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/198?cb=20221205215238)

From Player's Handbook pages 143-161.

The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.

## Starting Equipment[]

When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps.

### Starting Wealth by Class[]

| Class | Funds |
| --- | --- |
| Artificer | 5d4 x 10 gp |
| Barbarian | 2d4 x 10 gp |
| Bard | 5d4 x 10 gp |
| Cleric | 5d4 x 10 gp |
| Druid | 2d4 x 10 gp |
| Fighter | 5d4 x 10 gp |
| Monk | 5d4 gp |
| Paladin | 5d4 x 10 gp |
| Ranger | 5d4 x 10 gp |
| Rogue | 4d4 x 10 gp |
| Sorcerer | 3d4 x 10 gp |
| Warlock | 4d4 x 10 gp |
| Wizard | 4d4 x 10 gp |

## Wealth[]

Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. Members of the nobility trade in legal rights, such as the rights to mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire deal in coins.

### Coinage[]

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a quiver, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a set of dice, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

### Standard Exchange Rates[]

| Coin | cp | sp | ep | gp | pp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Copper (cp) | 1 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1000 |
| Silver (sp) | 10 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/100 |
| Electrum (ep) | 50 | 5 | 1 | 1/2 | 1/20 |
| Gold (gp) | 100 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1/10 |
| Platinum (pp) | 1000 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 1 |

### Selling Treasure[]

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

***Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.*** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

***Magic Items.*** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn't too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won't normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

***Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.*** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

***Trade Goods.*** Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

## Variant: Equipment Sizes[]

In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling's leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant's elegant robe.

The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.

Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

## Armor and Shields[]

:   *Main article: Armor*

D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between.

## Weapons[]

:   *Main article: Weapons*

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

## Adventuring Gear[]

:   *Main article: Adventuring Gear*

## Tools[]

:   *Main article: Tools*

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

## Mounts and Vehicles[]

:   *Main article: Mounts and Vehicles*

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down.

## Trade Goods[]

Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

### Trade Goods[]

| Cost | Goods |
| --- | --- |
| 1 cp | 1 lb. of wheat |
| 2 cp | 1 lb. of flour or one chicken |
| 5 cp | 1 lb. of salt |
| 1 sp | 1 lb. of iron or 1 sq. yd. of canvas |
| 5 sp | 1 lb. of copper or 1 sq. yd. of cotton cloth |
| 1 gp | 1 lb. of ginger or one goat |
| 2 gp | 1 lb. of cinnamon or pepper, or one sheep |
| 3 gp | 1 lb. of cloves or one pig |
| 5 gp | 1 lb. of silver or 1 sq. yd. of linen |
| 10 gp | 1 sq. yd. of silk or one cow |
| 15 gp | 1 lb. of saffron or one ox |
| 50 gp | 1 lb. of gold |
| 500 gp | 1 lb. of platinum |

## Expenses[]

:   *Main article: Expenses*

When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

## Trinkets[]

:   *Main article: Trinkets*

When you make your character, you can roll once on the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table. It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a creature's pockets.

## Lifestyle Expenses[]

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

| Lifestyle | Price/Day | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wretched | — | You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people. |
| Squalid | 1 sp | You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease. |
| Poor | 2 sp | A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types. |
| Modest | 1 gp | A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like. |
| Comfortable | 2 gp | Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers. |
| Wealthy | 4 gp | Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants. |
| Aristocratic | 10 gp minimum | You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant. |

## Food, Drink, and Lodging[]

The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.

| Item | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| *Ale* | |
| Gallon | 2 sp |
| Mug | 4 cp |
| Banquet (per person) | 10 gp |
| Bread, loaf | 2 cp |
| Cheese, hunk | 1 sp |
| *Inn stay (per day)* | |
| Squalid | 7 cp |
| Poor | 1 sp |
| Modest | 5 sp |
| Comfortable | 8 sp |
| Wealthy | 2 gp |
| Aristocratic | 4 gp |
| *Meals (per day)* | |
| Squalid | 3 cp |
| Poor | 6 cp |
| Modest | 3 sp |
| Comfortable | 5 sp |
| Wealthy | 8 sp |
| Aristocratic | 2 gp |
| Meat, chunk | 3 sp |
| *Wine* | |
| Common (pitcher) | 2 sp |
| Fine (bottle) | 10 gp |

### Self-Sufficiency[]

The expenses and lifestyles described assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford — paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.

Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

### Explorer's Guide to Wildemount[]

#### Wines of Feolinn[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 65)

Tropical weather and fertile lands have enabled Feolinn to develop a prosperous wine trade across the Menagerie Coast and beyond. There is fierce competition between local families as well as the rival wineries of Kamordah in the empire, and the numerous wines exported from Feolinn can claim a respectable bit of coin, though the prices might vary depending on the market.

* **Solvia Groves Diamond Plum Wine:** 60 gp per botle
* **Oveso Family Dark Red:** 35 gp per bottle
* **Rustlecall's Evening Dream Plum Wine:** 40 gp per bottle
* **Solvia Groves Sunset White Wine:** 30 gp per bottle
* **Cuthras Silver Vineyard Premium Red Wine:** 30 gp per bottle

#### Wines of Kamordah[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 89)

The natural phenomenon that churns the mud and earth surrounding Kamordah has helped its people cultivate a valuable collection of vineyards. Wines produced by these familes are some of the best in Exandria, often presented as extravagant gifts or a display of wealth. These bottles fetch a hefty sum of gold, with some of the finest listed below, though these prices vary depending on the market.

* **Stassman's Thistle Branch Dark Blood Red Wine:** 85 gp per bottle
* **Wagner & Waltz Emerald Embrace Green Wine:** 65 gp per bottle
* **Stassman's Truscan Sunrise White Wine:** 45 gp per bottle
* **Lionell Vineyard Purple Cedar Red Wine:** 30 gp per bottle
* **Errenath Family Private Wish Red Wine:** 25 gp per bottle

#### Herbs of the Othemoor[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 70)

The rich, primal nature of the Othemoor marsh nurtures a number of rare and highly sought-after grasses and herbs. Herbalists, alchemists, and spice traders often visit Othe to bolster their stores. Below are a number of the herbal goods often found for sale within Othe:

* **Theki Root:** This thick marsh root tastes bitter but is thought to aid digestive health. When you use an action to consume a dose, you gain advantage on saving throws against the effects of poisonous or toxic substances for 8 hours. *Cost:* 3 gp per dose.
* **Muroosa Balm:** This paste made from the muroosa bush is known to help prevent sunburn, but it is also a fire retardant. After spending 1 minute applying a quarter pint of muroosa balm to your skin, you gain resistance against fire damage for 1 hour. *Cost:* 1 gp per dose for sunburn, 100 gp for a full application against fire.
* **Olisuba Leaf:** These dried leaves of the Olisuba tree, when steeped to make a tea, can help a body recover from strenuous activity. If you drink a dose of Olisuba tea during a long rest, your exhaustion level is reduced by 2 instead of 1 at the end of that long rest. *Cost:* 50 gp per dose.
* **Willowshade Oil:** A dark blue oil can be extracted from the rare fruit of the willowshade plant. A creature can use its action to apply the oil to another creature that has been petrified for less than 1 minute, causing the petrified condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature's next turn. *Cost:* 30 gp per dose.

#### Skyships[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 72)

Luxurious passage through the clouds themselves — it's a romantic idea cultivated to appeal to the wealthiest citizens of Exandria. As an added bonus, skyship travel avoids the inherent dangers of a journey by land or sea, and is more readily available than teleportation magic. These beautiful airships range in size but generally are the same size as a merchant coaster. Skyships are held aloft and guided with the help of three or more enchanted crystals called brumestones, which are installed along the hull or topside of the ship. The enchantments required to produce and maintain these brumestones are closely guarded by the Alsfarin Union within the distant city of Ank'Harel. While the Alsfarin Union occasionally sells skyships to foreign businesses, they retain absolute control over the maintenance of skyships in operation.

Skyships are reserved for goods and individuals who want to circumvent the slow speed or danger of an ocean voyage and can afford the exorbitant cost of air travel. No commoner can afford to charter a skyship, and the lower classes of Exandria generally see air travel as just another way for the wealthy elite to lord their superiority over the poor. Others, however, see the majestic craft as aspirational and long to become rich enough to afford one, or skilled enough to pilot one.

Port Damali is the only city in Wildemount with an open skyport. The others are in the cities of Ank'Harel, Vasselheim, Emon, and Whitestone. Few skyships in service will deviate from the dedicated shipping routes between these major cities.

| Skyship | |
| --- | --- |
| **Purchase Cost:** | 100,000 gp |
| **Speed:** | 10 mph |
| **Maximum Cargo:** | 10 tons |
| **Crew:** | 6-10 |
| **Maximum Passenger Occupancy:** | 30 |
| **Personal Travel Cost:** | 2 gp per mile per passenger |
| **Shipping Cost:** | 1 gp per 100 pounds per mile |

#### Dyolet Fruit[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 108)

A round, blue fruit roughly the size of a plum, a dyolet is known for its sweet flavor and the mild surge of energy granted to whoever eats it. Dyolets can also be imbued with minor healing abilities, a property kept secret by the gnomes of the Velvin Thicket until recent years. Herbalists and apothecaries can imbue healing within the fruit for a fraction of the time and gold cost of brewing a potion. A dyolet can be imbued with one of the following properties by a character proficient with a healer's kit:

* You can saturate the fruit with carefully brewed curative draughts to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a Potion of Healing. This process takes 12 hours and costs 15 gp.
* You can saturate the fruit with strengthened restorative properties to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a Potion of Greater Healing. This process takes 4 days and costs 70 gp.

You can consume a dyolet as an action to gain its healing effect. A dyolet lasts up to 20 days after being harvested before it begins to rot. A rotting dyolet loses its healing properties.

#### Pride Silk[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 103)

The hearty silk unique to the region has long been a point of pride with the locals. When processed and woven properly, the resulting cloth is pride silk: an extremely flexible material with the durability of tanned leather. Pride silk has become a favorite cloth for use on military ship sails, war banners, and other utilitarian applications, but has also gained popularity in affluent circles. High-end clothing made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it. The tailors skilled enough to create such outfits are few and far between, so while pride silk might be expensive as a raw material, outfits made of the cloth are prohibitively expensive for most common folk.

One square yard of pride silk weighs 1 pound and costs 100 gp. An outfit made of pride silk weighs 4 pounds and costs 500 gp. If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 11 + your Dexterity modifier while wearing it.

#### Blightshore Contraband[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 152)

The unique environs of the post-Calamity Miskath Strand have produced a number of strange new substances that can be cultivated for both noble and illicit purposes. The regulation of these bizarre drugs proves difficult, however, as their exotic qualities often confound those who would subvert their questionable usage. As such, supply and demand remain steady despite the inevitable hazards of production.

* **Black Sap:** This tarry substance harvested from the dark boughs of the death's head willow is a powerful intoxicant. It can be smoked as a concentrate or injected directly into the bloodstream. A creature subjected to a dose of black sap cannot be charmed or frightened for 1d6 hours. For each dose of black sap consumed, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 2d4 hours — an effect that is cumulative with multiple doses. Black sap is valued at 300 gp per dose.
* **Blight Ichor:** This bitter chartreuse concoction is distilled from a fungus native to the Blightshore badlands. The sickly green liqueur harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as vulnerability to psychic damage, for 1 hour. For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1d6 hours and suffer the effects of a Confusion spell for 1 minute. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on all Dexterity checks and is immune to the frightened condition for 1 hour. Blight ichor is valued at 200 gp per dose.
* **Soothsalts:** Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline substance discovered throughout the wilds of the Miskath Strand. The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous veins like those in the mouth of the Miskath Pit and found within smaller geode formations near sites ravaged by the Calamity. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain around their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours. For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion — an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses. Soothsalts are valued at 150 gp per dose.

## Services[]

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund's secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

| Service | Pay |
| --- | --- |
| *Coach cab* | |
| Between towns | 3 cp per mile |
| Coach cab, Within a city | 1 cp |
| *Hireling* | |
| Skilled | 2 gp per day |
| Untrained | 2 sp per day |
| Messenger | 2 cp per mile |
| Road or gate toll | 1 cp |
| Ship's passage | 1 sp per mile |

## Spellcasting Services[]

People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as Cure Wounds or Identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment — the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.

### Adventurer's League Pricing[]

(Adventurer's League: Dungeon Master's Guide, Version 9.1)

The following information is from the Adventurer's League, which are official games organized by Wizards of the Coast. Your DM may not use this.

During a session, characters can receive spellcasting services from an NPC located anywhere that is town-sized or larger but must be able to travel there. Otherwise, they're available only between sessions.

| Magic Item Table | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Cure Wounds | 10 gp |
| Identify | 20 gp |
| Lesser Restoration | 40 gp |
| Prayer of Healing | 40 gp |
| Dispel Magic | 90 gp |
| Remove Curse | 90 gp |
| Speak With Dead | 90 gp |
| Divination | 210 gp |
| Greater Restoration | 450 gp |
| Raise Dead | 1,000 gp |
| Resurrection | 3,000 gp |
| True Resurrection | 30,000 gp |

***Acolyte Background.*** Characters with the Shelter of the Faithful background feature can request spellcasting services at a temple of their faith. Once per day they can receive one spell from the Spellcasting Services table for free (though they must provide the cost of any material component needed). Only some faiths are represented by temples large enough to provide this benefit.

## Recurring Expenses[]

(Dungeon Master's Guide, page 127)

Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional drains on their adventuring income. Player characters who come into possession of property, own businesses, and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that accompany these ventures.

It's not unusual for adventurers — especially after 10th level — to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, obtain it in a lucky draw from a Deck of Many Things, or acquire it by other means.

The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. The cost of a normal residence isn't included here because it falls under lifestyle expenses. Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can make payments in the party's absence.

| Property | Total Cost  per Day | Skilled  Hirelings | Untrained  Hirelings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Abbey | 20 gp | 5 | 25 |
| Farm | 5 sp | 1 | 2 |
| Guildhall, town or city | 5 gp | 5 | 3 |
| Inn, rural roadside | 10 gp | 5 | 10 |
| Inn, town or city | 5 gp | 1 | 5 |
| Keep or small castle | 100 gp | 50 | 50 |
| Lodge, hunting | 5 sp | 1 | — |
| Noble estate | 10 gp | 3 | 15 |
| Outpost or fort | 50 gp | 20 | 40 |
| Palace or large castle | 400 gp | 200 | 100 |
| Shop | 2 gp | 1 | — |
| Temple, large | 25 gp | 10 | 10 |
| Temple, small | 1 gp | 2 | — |
| Tower, fortified | 25 gp | 10 | — |
| Trading post | 10 gp | 4 | 2 |

***Total Cost per Day.*** The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns money that can offset maintenance costs (by charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in the table.

***Skilled and Untrained Hirelings.*** See Services for the difference between a skilled hireling and an untrained one.

### Businesses[]

An adventurer-owned business can earn enough money to cover its own maintenance costs. However, the owner needs to periodically ensure that everything is running smoothly by tending to the business between adventures. See the information on running a business on the Downtime Activities page.

### Garrisons[]

Castles and keeps employ soldiers (use the Veteran and Guard statistics) to defend them. Roadside inns, outposts and forts, palaces, and temples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the Guard statistics). These armed warriors make up the bulk of a property's skilled hirelings.

# Mounts and Vehicles

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/c/c5/Gorse.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/268?cb=20221129101748)

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

## Contents

* 1 Options
* 2 Mounts and Other Animals
* 3 Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles
  + 3.1 Chariots
* 4 Waterborne Vehicles
  + 4.1 Owning a Ship
* 5 Airborne Vehicles

## Options[]

***Barding.*** Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

***Saddles.*** A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

***Vehicle Proficiency.*** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

***Rowed Vessels.*** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

## Mounts and Other Animals[]

| Item | Cost | Speed | Capacity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Camel | 50 gp | 50 ft. | 480 lbs. |
| Donkey or mule | 8 gp | 40 ft. | 420 lbs. |
| Elephant | 200 gp | 40 ft. | 1,320 lbs. |
| Horse, draft | 50 gp | 40 ft. | 540 lbs. |
| Horse, riding | 75 gp | 60 ft. | 480 lbs. |
| Mastiff | 25 gp | 40 ft. | 195 lbs. |
| Moorbounder (EGtW 132) | 300-500 gp | 70 ft. | 540 lbs. |
| Pony | 30 gp | 40 ft. | 225 lbs. |
| Warhorse | 400 gp | 60 ft. | 540 lbs. |

## Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles[]

| Item | Cost | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Barding | x4 | x2 |
| Bit and bridle | 2 gp | 1 lbs. |
| Carriage | 100 gp | 600 lbs. |
| Cart | 15 gp | 200 lbs. |
| Chariot | 250 gp | 100 lbs. |
| Feed (per day) | 5 cp | 10 lbs. |
| Griffon Feed (per day) | 20 cp | 10 Ibs. |
| *Saddle* | | |
| Exotic | 60 gp | 40 lbs. |
| Military | 20 gp | 30 lbs. |
| Pack | 5 gp | 15 lbs. |
| Riding | 10 gp | 25 lbs. |
| Saddlebags | 4 gp | 8 lbs. |
| Sled | 20 gp | 300 lbs. |
| Stabling (per day) | 5 sp | — |
| Wagon | 35 gp | 400 lbs. |

### Chariots[]

(Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 196)

Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules, but with the following differences:

* Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
* Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.
* A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
* If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.

## Waterborne Vehicles[]

| Item | Cost | Speed | Crew | Passengers | Cargo (tons) | AC | HP | Damage Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Galley | 30,000 gp | 4 mph | 80 | — | 150 | 15 | 500 | 20 |
| Keelboat | 3,000 gp | 1 mph | 1 | 6 | 1/2 | 15 | 100 | 10 |
| Longship | 10,000 gp | 3 mph | 40 | 150 | 10 | 15 | 300 | 15 |
| Rowboat | 50 gp | 1 1/2 mph | 1 | 3 | — | 11 | 50 | — |
| Sailing ship | 10,000 gp | 2 mph | 20 | 20 | 100 | 15 | 300 | 15 |
| Warship | 25,000 gp | 2 1/2 mph | 60 | 60 | 200 | 15 | 500 | 20 |

### Owning a Ship[]

At some point in your campaign, the adventurers might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or capture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It's up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a ship at any time should it become a nuisance.

***Crew.*** A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to function. As per the Player's Handbook, one skilled hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles tables.

You can track the loyalty of individual crew members or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members leave the ship and never return.

***Passengers.*** The table indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers.

A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.

***Cargo.*** The table indicates the maximum tonnage each kind of ship can carry.

***Damage Threshold.*** A ship has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points.

***Ship Repair.*** Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.

## Airborne Vehicles[]

| Name | Cost | Speed | Crew | Maximum Capacity | Cargo (tons) | AC | HP | Personal Travel Cost | Shipping Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Airship(DMG 119) | 20,000 gp | 8 mph | 10 | 20 passengers | 1 | 13 | 300 | — | — |
| Skyship(EGW 72) | 100,000 gp | 10 mph | 6-10 | 30 | 10 | — | — | 2 gp/day per person | 1 gp/100 lbs. per mile |

# Tools

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/c/c5/Tools.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/240?cb=20221129101951)

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

## Artisan's Tools[]

These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency.

### Alchemist's Supplies[]

Alchemist's supplies enable a character to produce useful concoctions, such as acid or alchemist's fire.

| Activity | DC |
| --- | --- |
| Create a puff of thick smoke | 10 |
| Identify a poison | 10 |
| Identify a substance | 15 |
| Start a fire | 15 |
| Neutralize acid | 20 |

***Components.*** Alchemist's supplies include two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron, and purified water.

***Arcana.*** Proficiency with alchemist's supplies allows you to unlock more information on Arcana checks involving potions and similar materials.

***Investigation.*** When you inspect an area for clues, proficiency with alchemist's supplies grants additional insight into any chemicals or other substances that might have been used in the area.

***Alchemical Crafting.*** You can use this tool proficiency to create alchemical items. A character can spend money to collect raw materials, which weigh 1 pound for every 50 gp spent. The DM can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. As part of a long rest, you can use alchemist's supplies to make one dose of acid, alchemist's fire, antitoxin, oil, perfume, or soap. Subtract half the value of the created item from the total gp worth of raw materials you are carrying.

### Brewer's Supplies[]

Brewing is the art of producing beer. Not only does beer serve as an alcoholic beverage, but the process of brewing purifies water. Crafting beer takes weeks of fermentation, but only a few hours of work.

### Calligrapher's Supplies[]

Calligraphy treats writing as a delicate, beautiful art. Calligraphers produce text that is pleasing to the eye, using a style that is difficult to forge. Their supplies also give them some ability to examine scripts and determine if they are legitimate, since a calligrapher's training involves long hours of studying writing and attempting to replicate its style and design.

| Activity | DC |

***Stealth.*** You can quickly assess the weak spots in a wooden floor, making it easier to avoid the places that creak and groan when they're stepped on.

***Fortify.*** With 1 minute of work and raw materials, you can make a door or window harder to force open. Increase the DC needed to open it by 5.

***Temporary Shelter.*** As part of a long rest, you can construct a lean-to or a similar shelter to keep your group dry and in the shade for the duration of the rest. Because it was fashioned quickly from whatever wood was available, the shelter collapses 1d3 days after being assembled.

### Cartographer's Tools[]

Using cartographer's tools, you can create accurate maps to make travel easier for yourself and those who come after you. These maps can range from large-scale depictions of mountain ranges to diagrams that show the layout of a dungeon level.

For instance, you might spot hidden messages in a map, identify when the map was made to determine if geographical features have changed since then, and so forth.

***Nature.*** Your familiarity with physical geography makes it easier for you to answer questions or solve issues relating to the terrain around you.

***Survival.*** Your understanding of geography makes it easier to find paths to civilization, to predict areas where villages or towns might be found, and to avoid becoming lost. You have studied so many maps that common patterns, such as how trade routes evolve and where settlements arise in relation to geographic locations, are familiar to you.

***Craft a Map.*** While traveling, you can draw a map as you go in addition to engaging in other activity.

### Cobbler's Tools[]

Although the cobbler's trade might seem too humble for an adventurer, a good pair of boots will see a character across rugged wilderness and through deadly dungeons.

| Activity | DC |
| --- | --- |
| Determine a shoe's age and origin | 10 |
| Find a hidden compartment in a boot heel | 15 |

***Components.*** Cobbler's tools consist of a hammer, an awl, a knife, a shoe stand, a cutter, spare leather, and thread.

***Arcana, History.*** Your knowledge of shoes aids you in identifying the magical properties of enchanted boots or the history of such items.

***Investigation.*** Footwear holds a surprising number of secrets. You can learn where someone has recently visited by examining the wear and the dirt that has accumulated on their shoes. Your experience in repairing shoes makes it easier for you to identify where damage might come from.

***Maintain Shoes.*** As part of a long rest, you can repair your companions' shoes. For the next 24 hours, up to six creatures of your choice who wear shoes you worked on can travel up to 10 hours a day without making saving throws to avoid exhaustion.

***Craft Hidden Compartment.*** With 8 hours of work, you can add a hidden compartment to a pair of shoes. The compartment can hold an object up to 3 inches long and 1 inch wide and deep. You make an Intelligence check using your tool proficiency to determine the Intelligence (Investigation) check DC needed to find the compartment.

### Cook's Utensils[]

***Components.*** The tools include a blowpipe, a small marver, blocks, and tweezers. You need a source of heat to work glass.

***Arcana, History.*** Your knowledge of glassmaking techniques aids you when you examine glass objects, such as potion bottles or glass items found in a treasure hoard. For instance, you can study how a glass potion bottle has been changed by its contents to help determine a potion's effects. (A potion might leave behind a residue, deform the glass, or stain it.)

***Investigation.*** When you study an area, your knowledge can aid you if the clues include broken glass or glass objects.

***Identify Weakness.*** With 1 minute of study, you can identify the weak points in a glass object. Any damage dealt to the object by striking a weak spot is doubled.

### Jeweler's Tools[]

Training with jeweler's tools includes the basic techniques needed to beautify gems. It also gives you expertise in identifying precious stones.

***Components.*** Jeweler's tools consist of a small saw and hammer, files, pliers, and tweezers.

***Arcana.*** Proficiency with jeweler's tools grants you knowledge about the reputed mystical uses of gems. This insight proves handy when you make Arcana checks related to gems or gem-encrusted items.

***Investigation.*** When you inspect jeweled objects, your proficiency with jeweler's tools aids you in picking out clues they might hold.

***Identify Gems.*** You can identify gems and determine their value at a glance.

# Weapons

![Without weapons the bad guys with.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/a/ae/Weapons.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/251?cb=20221129093822)

Without weapons the bad guys with.

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency[]

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Properties[]

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

***Ammunition.*** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

***Loading.*** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

***Range.*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

***Reach.*** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.

***Special.*** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Improvised Weapons[]

Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Silvered Weapons[]

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

## Adamantine Weapons[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 78)

Adamantine is an ultra-hard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft adamantine armor, the metal is also used for weapons.

Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated.

## Special Weapons[]

Weapons with special rules are described here.

***Lance.*** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

***Net.*** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

***Double-Bladed Scimitar.*** *(Eberron: Rising From the Last War).* The double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever even get the opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon or received it from a dying ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class.

When you make a two-handed attack with this weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the other side of the blade. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary. The damage die is 1d4, and it deals slashing damage. This special attack can only be done if you take the Attack action.
