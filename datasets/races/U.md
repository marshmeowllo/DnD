# Vampire (Race)

From Plane Shift: Ixalan, page 14; and Plane Shift: Zendikar, page 14.

## Traits[]

(Plane Shift: Ixalan, page 14)

Your vampire character has the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Vampires don't mature and age in the same way that other races do.

***Alignment.*** Vampires might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, their strict hierarchies incline them toward a lawful alignment.

***Size.*** Vampires are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Vampiric Resistance.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Bloodthirst.*** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Feast of Blood.*** When you drain blood with your Bloodthirst ability, you experience a surge of vitality. Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws for 1 minute.

## Plane Shift: Zendikar[]

(Plane Shift: Zendikar, page 14)

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Vampires don't mature and age in the same way that other races do. Every living vampire is either a bloodchief, infected by Ulamog's influence in the distant reaches of history, or was spawned by a bloodchief from a living human. Most vampires are thus very old, but few have any memory of their earliest years.

***Alignment.*** Vampires have no innate tendency toward evil, but consuming the life energy of other creatures often pushes them to that end. Regardless of their moral bent, the strict hierarchies of their bloodchiefs inclines them toward a lawful alignment.

***Size.*** Vampires are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Vampiric Resistance.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Blood Thirst.*** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid killed in this way becomes a null.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Vampire.

# Warforged

From Eberron: Rising From the Last War, page 36; Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 69; Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron, Unearthed Arcana: Eberron.

 ![Warforgeddefinitely](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/d/da/Warforgeddefinitely.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230401211229) 

A warforged can come in many different shapes and forms. Some more human-like than others.

 

The **Warforged** are a species of sentient, living robotic beings (mostly) originating from the distant world of Eberron

The designation "Warforged" stems from the species' generally-shared ability to war and to reforge their bodies at will, rearranging their component parts from a robotic primary mode (usually, but not always, humanoid) into an alternate form; generally vehicles, weapons, machinery, or animals. In some continuities this ability to transform is innate to all members of the species, in others it was a wartime innovation that was adopted by most, but not all, of the populace.
