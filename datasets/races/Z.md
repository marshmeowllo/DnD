# Aarakocra (Race)

From Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 6; Elemental Evil Player's Companion, page 5; and Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 165.

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 6)

As an aarakocra, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Flight.*** Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Talons.*** You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Wind Caller.*** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Gust of Wind spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast gust of wind with this trait (choose when you select this race).

## Explorer's Guide to Wildemount[]

(Elemental Evil Player's Companion, page 5; Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 165)

As an aarakocra, you have certain traits in common with your people. Being able to fly at high speed starting at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. As a result, playing an aarakocra requires special consideration by your DM.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3. Compared to humans, aarakocra don't usually live longer than 30 years.

***Alignment.*** Most aarakocra are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.

***Size.*** Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall. They have thin, lightweight bodies that weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Talons.*** You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Aarakocra, and Auran.

# Aetherborn

From Plane Shift: Kaladesh, page 17.

## Traits[]

Your aetherborn character has certain traits deriving from your unusual nature.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age.*** Aetherborn come into being as adults and live no more than a few years.

***Alignment.*** As a rule, aetherborn are driven by hedonism and self-interest, making them neutral at best and thoroughly evil at worst. Neutral aetherborn might devote much of their time (and wealth) to parties and social activity, while evil aetherborn are usually involved in the criminal underworld.

***Size.*** Aetherborn are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. They are quite light — only about 100 pounds — and their weight diminishes as they age and more and more of their substance returns to the aethersphere. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Born of Aether.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.

## Gift of the Aetherborn[]

An unknown aetherborn, desperately seeking a means to extend their short life, discovered a process of transformation that prolonged their existence — by giving them the ability to feed on the life essence of other beings. Since then, other aetherborn have learned and carried out this monstrous transformation, and aetherborn with this "gift" have become a small minority among an already small population.

A gifted aetherborn has the ability to drain the life essence of other beings. Similar to the way heat is transferred from a warm object to a cold one, a gifted aetherborn need only touch another living being with a clawed hand to draw life essence out, fueling their own continued existence while draining strength and vitality from their victim.

For many aetherborn, living as they do for indulgence and instant gratification, the concepts of "want" and "need" are virtually synonymous. But Aetherborn with this gift understand what it is to truly need, for they develop a hunger for life essence that far exceeds any desires they might have felt before their transformation. A gifted aetherborn who abstains from this feeding deteriorates even more rapidly than other aetherborn, while enduring unspeakable agony caused by the deprivation of life energy.

At the DM's option, an aetherborn character can research methods of achieving this dark "gift." The process is similar to inventing and manufacturing a rare magic item (see "Inventing and Manufacturing Devices" earlier in this document). But rather than aether, the process requires a variety of rare unguents and unusual ingredients that make up the cost of researching and undergoing the transformation.

An aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability: a natural attack that deals 1d6 necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6 per week. This reduction can't be removed until the aetherborn has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

# Aven

## Contents

* 1 Traits
  + 1.1 Ibis-headed
  + 1.2 Hawk-headed
* 2 Plane Shift: Dominaria

## Traits[]

(Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 15)

All aven share the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can theoretically live into their 80s. Of course, most find a glorious (or inglorious) death long before that point.

***Alignment.*** Most aven lean toward some form of neutrality. Ibis-headed aven, focused more on knowledge than any other virtue, are usually neutral. Hawk-headed aven are inclined toward lawful neutral.

***Size.*** Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Flying.*** You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.)

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aven.

***Subrace.*** Choose one of two subraces for your character.

### Ibis-headed[]

A majority of ibis-headed aven, drawn to the teachings of Kefnet, specialize in spellcasting. They take great pride in all the qualities they share with the god of knowledge — not just their avian heads, but their quick wit, self-confidence, cunning, and spellcasting prowess.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Kefnet's Blessing.*** You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any Intelligence check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### Hawk-headed[]

Following the example of Oketra, hawk-headed aven often focus on the techniques of long-range combat. Most prefer javelins, but some are skilled with bows, spears, and throwing axes.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2.

***Hawkeyed.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

## Plane Shift: Dominaria[]

(Plane Shift: Dominaria, page 6)

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.

***Age.*** Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can live into their 80s.

***Alignment.*** Aven are inclined toward the lawful good alignment of the Church of Serra.

***Size.*** Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.)

***Hawkeyed.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Aven and Common.

A goblinkin targeted by Remove Curse can also make this saving throw, with advantage on the save if the caster is a trusted companion.

# Centaur

From Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 19; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 15; and Unearthed Arcana: Centaurs and Minotaurs.

## Traits[]

(Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 19; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 15)

Your centaur character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
* **Age:** Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.
* **Alignment:** Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. On Ravnica, those who join the Selesnya are more often neutral good, while those who join the Gruul are typically chaotic neutral. On Theros, Lagonna centaurs tend to be more lawful, while Pheres centaurs are more often chaotic.
* **Size:** Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:
  + Size modifier = 1d10
  + Height = 6 feet + your size modifier in inches
  + Weight in pounds = 600 + (2d12 x your size modifier)
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
* **Fey:** Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
* **Charge:** If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.
* **Hooves:** Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
* **Equine Build:** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

:   In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

* **Survivor:** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural phenomena and spiritual forces.

## Unearthed Arcana[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Centaurs and Minotaurs)

**Consult your DM before using this version.** It is usually considered unofficial and invalid due to updated material.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
* **Age:** Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.
* **Alignment:** Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality.
* **Size:** Your size is Medium, yet you tower over most other humanoids.
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
* **Charge:** If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
* **Hooves:** Your hooves are natural melee weapons, with which you're proficient. If you hit with a hoof, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
* **Equine Build:** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.
* **Survivor:** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.
* **Hybrid Nature:** You have two creature types: humanoid and monstrosity. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.

# Changeling

From Eberron: Rising From the Last War, page 18; Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 60; Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron; and Unearthed Arcana: Eberron.

**This race is designed for Eberron settings.** Check with your DM before using it in other settings.

## Traits[]

(Eberron Rising From the Last War, page 18)

Your changeling character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.
* **Age:** Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan — typically a century or less. While a changeling can shapeshift to conceal their age, the effects of aging still catch up to them.
* **Alignment:** Changelings hate to be bound in any way, and those who follow the path of the Traveler believe that chaos and change are important aspects of life. Most tend toward pragmatic neutrality as opposed to being concerned with lofty ideals. Few changelings embrace evil.
* **Size:** In their natural forms, changelings average between 5 and 6 feet in height, with a slender build. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Shapechanger:** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.

:   You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.

* **Changeling Instincts:** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.

Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.

* **Unsettling Visage:** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
* **Divergent Persona:** You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a persona associated with that proficiency: establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details.

***Gift of the Svirfneblin.*** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Disguise Self spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the Nondetection spell with it, without requiring a material component. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with your bite. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite.

When you attack with this bite and hit a creature that isn't a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:

* You regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt by the bite.
* You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the piercing damage dealt by the bite.

You can empower yourself with your bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

(Player's Handbook, pages 32-34)

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

***Size.*** Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Draconic Ancestry.*** You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

| Dragon | Damage Type | Breath Weapon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Black | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| Blue | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| Brass | Fire | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| Bronze | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| Copper | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |

| Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |
| Silver | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Con. save) |
| White | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Con. save) |

***Breath Weapon.*** You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

### Draconblood[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 168)

A draconblood uses the dragonborn traits in the Play­er's Handbook, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Damage Resistance traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Forceful Presence.*** You can use your understanding of creative diplomacy or intimidation to guide a conversation in your favor. When you make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Ravenite[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 168)

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Fizban's Treasury of Dragons[]

(Fizban's Treasury of Dragons, pages 9-12)

The dragonborn race in the Player's Handbook is the most direct way to reflect a character with dragons somewhere far back in their ancestry. But for players who want to try a more nuanced approach, this section offers three variant dragonborn race options that can be used to create a character with clear connections to a specific draconic ancestry. When you're making a new character using one of these races, use the rules under "Creating Your Character" to fill out the details.

### Chromatic Dragonborn[]

You have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Chromatic Ancestry.*** You have a chromatic dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Chromatic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
| --- | --- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| White | Cold |

***Breath Weapon.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Draconic Resistance.*** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry.

***Chromatic Warding.*** Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Gem Ancestry.*** You have a gem dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Gem Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
| --- | --- |
| Amethyst | Force |
| Crystal | Radiant |
| Emerald | Psychic |
| Sapphire | Thunder |
| Topaz | Necrotic |

***Breath Weapon.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Gem Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

***Gem Flight.*** Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Metallic Dragonborn[]

You have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

# Elf/Unearthed Arcana

< Elf

:   *To view the official mechanics and statistics of this class, see Elf.*

The material in this article is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not refined by full game design and editing. They aren't officially part of the game and aren't permitted in D&D Adventurers League events. **Ask your Dungeon Master before using any material on this page.**

If Wizards of the Coast decides to make this material official, it will be refined based on your feedback, and then it will appear in a D&D book.

## Race Options: Eladrin and Gith[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Race Options: Eladrin and Gith])

Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of unpredictability and boundless magic. At your DM's option, you can select eladrin as the subrace for an elf character, instead of one of the elf subraces in the Player's Handbook.

As creatures of the Feywild, eladrin can be wildly unpredictable. They tend toward an alignment of chaotic neutral, mixing a love of
freedom with benign self-interest. Eladrin that embrace good or evil take their beliefs to an extreme, serving as great champions of justice or terrifying villains.

### The Four Seasons[]

Each eladrin has four distinct personality states — one for each season — that they shift between when they experience powerful emotion.

**Autumn** is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all. Eladrin adopt this personality when overcome with contentment.

**Winter** is the season of dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. It is a time of sadness and regret, entered when eladrin are overcome with sorrow.

**Spring** is the season of cheerfulness and unfettered celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with joy.

**Summer** is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with fury.

You may create personality traits and flaws for each of your seasons, reflecting an eladrin's tempestuous personality. You can roll on the following tables or read them for inspiration. To add some chaos to your character, you may roll on these tables each time you change seasons.

#### Autumn[]

| 4 | A penny spent is a penny lost forever. |

| --- | --- |

| 2 | Nothing matters to you, and you allow others to guide your actions. |
| 3 | Your needs come first. In winter, all must watch out for themselves. |
| 4 | You speak only to point out the flaws in others' plans. |

#### Summer[]

| d4 | Summer Flaw |

### Eladrin Traits[]

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Intelligence score or your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Shifting Seasons:** At the end of each short or long rest, you can align yourself with the magic of one season, regardless of the season that is dominating your personality. Doing so allows you to cast a certain cantrip, as shown in the Shifting Seasons Cantrips table. When you align yourself with a season's magic, you lose the cantrip associated with the previous season and gain the cantrip associated with the new season.

:   Your spellcasting ability for these cantrips is Intelligence or Charisma, whichever is higher.

* **Flight:** You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

### Grugach[]

The grugach of the world of Greyhawk shun contact with other folk, preferring the solace of the deepest forests and the companionship of wild animals. Even other elves draw their suspicion.

The grugach tend toward chaos and neutrality. They feel no special duty to anyone beyond their own folk and the forest that is their home. Troubles beyond their borders are best kept there. At the same time, they harbor little ambition beyond a peaceful coexistence with nature.

If anyone is fool enough to disturb a grugach realm, these elves take to arms and fight in earnest. Grugach master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper's nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. The grugach set pits filled with stakes, snares that leave an intruder helpless to grugach arrows, and other snares designed to kill rather than capture. The grugach fight to the death to preserve their realms.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 1.
* **Grugach Weapon Training:** You have proficiency with the spear, shortbow, longbow, and net.
* **Cantrip:** You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.
* **Extra Language:** You don't know Common. Instead, you can speak, read, and write Sylvan.

### Shadar-kai[]

Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were elves like the rest of their kin, but now they exist in a strange state between life and death, their skin pale and their bodies marked by piercings and eerie tattoos.

* **Extra Language:** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choosing.
* **Cantrip:** You know one of the following cantrips of your choice: Chill Touch, Spare the Dying, or Thaumaturgy. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
* **Blessing of the Raven Queen:** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and you gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 14; The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, page 12)

As a fairy, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Fey.

***Size.*** You are Small.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Fairy Magic.*** You know the Druidcraft cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Faerie Fire spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the Enlarge/Reduce spell with this trait. Once you cast Faerie Fire or Enlarge/Reduce with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

***Flight.*** Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.

## Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild])

***Creature Type.*** You are a Fey.

***Size.*** You are Small.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Fairy Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. This flight is magical and does not require the use of your wings (if you have them).

***Fairy Magic.*** You know the Druidcraft and Faerie Fire spells. You can cast Faerie Fire without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

***Fey Passage.*** You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race such as the fairy, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race in this chapter tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell doesn't work on a Construct or an Undead.

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. Fairies, however, have a life span of about a century.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but you can use it no more than once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Firearms Mastery.*** You have a mystical connection to firearms that traces back to the gods of the giff, who delighted in such weapons. You have proficiency with all firearms and ignore the loading property of any firearm. In addition, attacking at long range with a firearm doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack roll.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

## Creating Your Character[]

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races, which include the race presented in this article. If you create a character using a race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The “Quick Build” section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. The race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

* **Clockwork Toy.** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
* **Fire Starter.** The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

  + 1.3 Mark of Storm
    - 1.3.1 Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron

***Skill Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

***Subrace.*** If your DM and setting allows it, you can possibly have one of several subraces for your half-elf character.

### Variant[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 116)

Some half-elves in Faerûn have a racial trait in place of the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take a trait based on your elf parentage:

***Deductive Intuition.*** When you make an Investigation or Insight check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you don't require material components for them.

***Spells of the Mark.*** If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Detection Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Detect Evil and Good, Detect Poison and Disease |
| 2nd | Detect Thoughts, Find Traps |
| 3rd | Clairvoyance, Nondetection |
| 4th | Arcane Eye, Divination |
| 5th | Legend Lore |

#### Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron[]

(Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 96)

These traits replace the half-elf's Ability Score Increase, Skill Versatility, and Languages given in the Player's Handbook.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Instead of the normal Ability Score Increase, your Intelligence score increases by 1, your Charisma score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Deductive Intuition.*** When you make an Investigation or Insight check, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.

***Sense Threats.*** You can cast the Detect Magic and Detect Poison and Disease spells, but only as rituals. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 1, your Wisdom score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.

***Imprint Prey.*** As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is imprinted in your mind until it dies or you use this trait again. Alternatively, you can imprint a creature as your quarry whenever you succeed on a Survival check to track it. When tracking your quarry, double the result of your Intuition die. When your quarry is within 60 feet of you, you have a sense of its location: it can't be hidden from you, gains no benefit from invisibility, and your attacks against it ignore half cover. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Sense Threats.*** When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast Locate Animals or Plants, but only as a ritual.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

# Harengon

From Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 22; The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, page 13; and Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild].

## Contents

* 1 Traits
* 2 Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild
* 3 Creating Your Character
  + 3.1 Ability Score Increases
  + 3.2 Languages
  + 3.3 Creature Type
  + 3.4 Lifespan
  + 3.5 Height and Weight

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 22; The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, page 13)

As a harengon, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Hare-Trigger.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

***Leporine Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Lucky Footwork.*** When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success. You can't use this reaction if you're prone or your speed is 0.

***Rabbit Hop.*** As a bonus action, you can jump a number of feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus, without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use this trait only if your speed is greater than 0. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild])

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hare-Trigger.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

***Leporine Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Lucky Footwork.*** When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the result, potentially turning the failure into a success.

***Rabbit Hop.*** Once during each of your turns when you walk at least 5 feet, you can hop, rolling a d12 and moving that many feet in a direction of your choice. This extra distance doesn't cost movement, but you can hop only if your speed isn't 0.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race such as the harengon, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race in this chapter tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell doesn't work on a Construct or an Undead.

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. Harengons, however, have a life span of about a century.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

# Hexblood

From Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, page 18.

## Traits[]

You have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Fey.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Ancestral Legacy.*** If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.

***Eerie Token.*** As a bonus action, you can harmlessly remove a lock of hair, one of your nails, or one of your teeth. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can take one of these actions:

* **Telepathic Message.** As an action, you can send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five words.
* **Remote Viewing.** If you are within 10 miles of the token, you can enter a trance as an action. The trance lasts 1 minute, but ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or are incapacitated. During this trance, you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is. While you are using your senses at the token's location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. When the trance ends, the token is harmlessly destroyed.

Once you create a token using this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows.

***Fey Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

***Hex Magic.*** You can cast the Disguise Self and Hex spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spells slots you have.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose the ability when you gain this lineage).

* **Passage.** You and the target of your Help action each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
* **Spite.** Until the start of your next turn, the first time you or the target of your Help action hits a creature with an attack roll, that creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll that it makes within the next minute.

***Fortune from the Many.*** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses you finish a long rest.

## Creating Your Character[]

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you create a character using a race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

# Hollow One

From Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, pages 181-182.

The Dungeon Master has the option to allow a character created in Wildemount to be a Hollow One. Alternatively, a character who perishes in the course of a campaign might return as a Hollow One, created by the mysterious forces that scar the land.

As a Hollow One, the void left behind by your departed soul is filled with the strange magic of Blightshore. Becoming a Hollow One is a supernatural gift that bestows upon you the following traits.

***Ageless.*** You don't age, and effects that cause you to age don't work.

***Cling to Life.*** When you roll a death saving throw and roll 16 or higher, you regain 1 hit point.

***Revenance.*** You retain your creature type, yet you register as Undead to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the Undead creature type.

***Unsettling Presence.*** As an action, you can unsettle a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes within the next minute. Constructs, Undead, and creatures that can't be frightened are immune to this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.

## Plane Shift: Innistrad[]

(Plane Shift: Innistrad, page 8)

Human characters on Innistrad have the following traits. If you use these human traits, do not use the variant human traits presented in the Player's Handbook. As well, in campaigns that use feats, characters should not be allowed to choose feats that duplicate any provincial traits.

***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment.

***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Innistrad is not a world with a variety of languages, unlike most D&D settings. The people who inhabit the world all speak the same tongue, and the most common monsters — including vampires, werewolves, and geists — speak it as well, since they were once human.

Ordinarily, all humans learn an additional language, and many backgrounds give access to languages as well — so the easiest way to deal with these extra languages is to ignore them. Humans speak only Common. If a background gives access to a language, the character can choose a tool proficiency instead.

***Provincial Origin.*** Choose one of the four provinces of Innistrad as the place of origin for your character.

### Gavony[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

### Kessig[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.

***Forest Folk.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.

***Fleet of Foot.*** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

***Sure-footed.*** When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.

***Spring Attack.*** When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of your turn, whether you hit or not.

### Nephalia[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence and Charisma scores each increase by 1.

***Breadth of Knowledge.*** You gain proficiency in any combination of four skills or with four tools of your choice.

### Stensia[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 1.

***Daunting.*** You have proficiency in the [[Intimidation skill.

***Tough.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 2, and it increases by 2 every time you gain a level.

## Plane Shift: Dominaria[]

(Plane Shift: Dominaria, page 19)

The humans of Keld, also called Keldon, have the following traits, which replace the standard human traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Keldons reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Keldons tend toward chaotic alignments, and many walk a fine line between good and evil.

***Size.*** Keldons are taller and heavier than the human norms of other cultures, standing almost universally above 6 feet tall and reaching heights above 7 feet. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Keldon.

***Natural Athlete.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.

***Keldon Resilience.*** You have proficiency in Strength saving throws.

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you create a character using the race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. The race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

# Minotaur

From Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 23; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 17; Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 19; Unearthed Arcana: Centaurs and Minotaurs; and Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures.

## Contents

* 1 Traits
* 2 Plane Shift: Amonkhet
* 3 Unearthed Arcana: Centaur and Minotaur
* 4 Krynn

## Traits[]

(Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 22; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 17)

Your minotaur character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
* **Age:** On Ravnica, minotaurs enter adulthood at around the age of 17 and can live up to 150 years. On Theros, minotaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.
* **Alignment:** On Ravnica, most minotaurs who join the Boros Legion lean toward lawful alignments, while those associated with the Cult of Rakdos or the Gruul Clans tend toward chaotic alignments. On Theros, minotaurs who leave the walls of Skophos have the opportunity to be free of its culture and pursue chaotic alignments, while those who remain within the polis and its tyrannical regime tend toward lawful alignments.
* **Size:** Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:
  + Size modifier = 2d8
  + Height = 5 feet + 4 inches + your size modifier in inches
  + Weight in pounds = 175 + (2d6 x your size modifier)
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Horns:** Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
* **Goring Rush:** Immediately after you use the dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.
* **Hammering Horns:** Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.
* **Imposing Presence:** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.

## Plane Shift: Amonkhet[]

(Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 19)

They typically become acolytes at around 8 or 9 years old, making them among the older members of their crops. Once they reach maturity, though, minotaurs age quickly, rushing headlong through the trials (as they do all aspects of life) to complete them before they pass their peak. A minotaur allowed to die of old age would rarely live beyond 40.
* **Alignment:** Most minotaurs lean toward chaotic alignments, and they have a slight inclination toward evil.
* **Size:** Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have strong, stocky builds. Your size is Medium.

* **Relentless Endurance:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
* **Savage Attacks:** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.

If you hit with your bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, and your target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 poison damage.

If you hit with your constrict attack, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and the target is grappled (escape DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and you can't constrict another target.

## Creating Your Character[]

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you create a character using a race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

## Traits[]

You have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

***Ancestral Legacy.*** If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

* You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
* You have advantage on death saving throws.

When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Revenant

From Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Heroes.

**Consult your DM before using this race.**

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

The revenant subrace can be applied to any race that has a subrace, and replaces that race's existing subrace options. Alternatively, you can apply this new subrace to a race without subrace options using the modification options provided below.

Your DM might also allow you to take this subrace for a slain character. In that case, your character rises from the dead with its original subrace replaced (or with the necessary modifications made to its base traits), filled with a determination to seek vengeance or complete its mission.

## Contents

* 1 Traits
* 2 Racial Adjustments
  + 2.1 Human Revenant
  + 2.2 Dragonborn Revenant
  + 2.3 Tiefling Revenant

## Traits[]

The following traits replace your subrace's traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
* **Relentless Nature:** Your DM assigns a goal to you — typically, one related to your character's death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:
  + If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.
  + If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.
  + You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

## Racial Adjustments[]

For races that don't have subrace options, taking on the revenant subrace means making changes to your character's base traits, as follows. This article provides options only for human and dragonborn characters. Because half-elves and half-orcs have no subrace options, they shouldn't be used with these revenant subrace rules.

### Human Revenant[]

If you want to play a Human revenant, modify the human's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. If you use the variant human traits, remove the Skills trait and the Feat trait.

### Dragonborn Revenant[]

If you want to play a Dragonborn revenant, modify the dragonborn's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Additionally, your Draconic Ancestry trait uses necrotic damage as its damage type, replacing the damage type that applies to your breath weapon and your damage resistance.

### Tiefling Revenant[]

Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes released several Tiefling variants that make use of subraces. Use the book to make a tiefling revenant, replacing the subrace options with the revenant subrace options.

# Simic Hybrid

From Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 20; and Unearthed Arcana: Races of Ravnica].

## Contents

* 1 Traits
  + 1.1 Animal Enhancement
* 2 Unearthed Arcana: Races of Ravnica
  + 2.1 Animal Enhancement

## Traits[]

(Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 20)

Your Simic hybrid character has the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves, or vedalken. They age at a slightly accelerated rate, so their maximum life spans are probably reduced somewhat. The Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.

***Alignment.*** Most hybrids share the generally neutral outlook of the Simic Combine. They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. Those who leave the Combine, however, often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild's.

***Size.*** Your size is Medium, within the normal range of your humanoid base race.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and your choice of Elvish or Vedalken.

### Animal Enhancement[]

Your body has been altered to incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and a second enhancement at 5th level.

At 1st level, choose one of the following options:

* **Manta Glide.** You have ray-like fins that you can use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.
* **Nimble Climber.** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
* **Underwater Adaptation.** You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level, or one of the following options:

* **Grappling Appendage.** You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.
* **Carapace.** Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.
* **Acid Spit.** As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Monstrosity.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Chameleon Carapace.*** While you aren't wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Secondary Arms.*** You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property.

***Sleepless.*** You do not require sleep and can remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.

***Thri-kreen Telepathy.*** Without the assistance of magic, you can't speak the non-thri-kreen languages you know. Instead you use telepathy to convey your thoughts. You have the magical ability to transmit your thoughts mentally to willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of yourself. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you to understand your thoughts, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.

***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

***Subrace.*** With your DM's approval, you can choose one of several subraces for your character. These subrace traits replace the Ability Score Increase feature and the Infernal Legacy feature, except the Variant subrace.

### Variant[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 118)

Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.

***Appearance.*** Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4+1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goatlike legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.

***Feral.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait fully replaces the Ability Score Increase trait.

***Devil's Tongue.*** You know the Vicious Mockery cantrip. When your reach 3rd level, you can cast the Charm Person spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Enthrall spell once with this trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells once again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

***Hellfire.*** You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Burning Hands spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

***Winged.*** You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

### Abyssal[]

( Unearthed Arcana: That Old Black Magic])

All abyssal tieflings trace their bloodline to the demons of the Abyss. These tieflings have the following additional features. These features replace the Ability Score Increase, Hellish Resistance, Infernal Legacy, and Languages traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Abyssal Arcana.*** Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd-level spell.

You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-level slot.

At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.

| d6 | 1st-level | 3rd-level | 5th-level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Dancing Lights | Burning Hands | Alter Self |
| 2 | True Strike | Charm Person | Darkness |
| 3 | Light | Magic Missile | Invisibility |
| 4 | Message | Cure Wounds | Levitate |
| 5 | Spare the Dying | Tasha's Hideous Laughter | Mirror Image |
| 6 | Prestidigitation | Thunderwave | Spider Climb |

***Abyssal Fortitude.*** Your hit point maximum increases by half your level (minimum 1).

***Languages.*** Instead of Infernal, you can speak, read, and write Abyssal.

(Plane Shift: Ixalan, page 14)

Your vampire character has the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Vampires don't mature and age in the same way that other races do.

***Alignment.*** Vampires might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, their strict hierarchies incline them toward a lawful alignment.

***Size.*** Vampires are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Vampiric Resistance.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Bloodthirst.*** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

(Plane Shift: Zendikar, page 14)

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Vampires don't mature and age in the same way that other races do. Every living vampire is either a bloodchief, infected by Ulamog's influence in the distant reaches of history, or was spawned by a bloodchief from a living human. Most vampires are thus very old, but few have any memory of their earliest years.

***Alignment.*** Vampires have no innate tendency toward evil, but consuming the life energy of other creatures often pushes them to that end. Regardless of their moral bent, the strict hierarchies of their bloodchiefs inclines them toward a lawful alignment.

***Size.*** Vampires are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Vampiric Resistance.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Blood Thirst.*** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid killed in this way becomes a null.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Vampire.

# Warforged

From Eberron: Rising From the Last War, page 36; Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 69; Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron, Unearthed Arcana: Eberron.

 ![Warforgeddefinitely](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/d/da/Warforgeddefinitely.webp/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230401211229) 

A warforged can come in many different shapes and forms. Some more human-like than others.

 

The **Warforged** are a species of sentient, living robotic beings (mostly) originating from the distant world of Eberron

The designation "Warforged" stems from the species' generally-shared ability to war and to reforge their bodies at will, rearranging their component parts from a robotic primary mode (usually, but not always, humanoid) into an alternate form; generally vehicles, weapons, machinery, or animals. In some continuities this ability to transform is innate to all members of the species, in others it was a wartime innovation that was adopted by most, but not all, of the populace.
