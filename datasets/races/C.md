# Centaur

From Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 19; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 15; and Unearthed Arcana: Centaurs and Minotaurs.

## Traits[]

(Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 19; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 15)

Your centaur character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
* **Age:** Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.
* **Alignment:** Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. On Ravnica, those who join the Selesnya are more often neutral good, while those who join the Gruul are typically chaotic neutral. On Theros, Lagonna centaurs tend to be more lawful, while Pheres centaurs are more often chaotic.
* **Size:** Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:
  + Size modifier = 1d10
  + Height = 6 feet + your size modifier in inches
  + Weight in pounds = 600 + (2d12 x your size modifier)
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
* **Fey:** Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
* **Charge:** If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.
* **Hooves:** Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
* **Equine Build:** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

:   In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

* **Survivor:** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural phenomena and spiritual forces.

(Unearthed Arcana: Centaurs and Minotaurs)

**Consult your DM before using this version.** It is usually considered unofficial and invalid due to updated material.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
* **Age:** Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.
* **Alignment:** Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality.
* **Size:** Your size is Medium, yet you tower over most other humanoids.
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
* **Charge:** If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
* **Hooves:** Your hooves are natural melee weapons, with which you're proficient. If you hit with a hoof, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
* **Equine Build:** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.
* **Survivor:** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.
* **Hybrid Nature:** You have two creature types: humanoid and monstrosity. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.

# Centaur (Race)

:   *To view the lore of the Centaur race, see Centaur (Race)/lore.*

From Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 9; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 19; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 15; and Unearthed Arcana: Centaurs and Minotaurs].

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 9)

As a centaur, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Fey.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 40 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Charge.*** If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.

***Equine Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

***Hooves.*** You have hooves that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Natural Affinity.*** Your fey connection to nature gives you an intuitive connection to the natural world and the animals within it. You therefore have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.

# Changeling

From Eberron: Rising From the Last War, page 18; Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 60; Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron; and Unearthed Arcana: Eberron.

**This race is designed for Eberron settings.** Check with your DM before using it in other settings.

## Traits[]

(Eberron Rising From the Last War, page 18)

Your changeling character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.
* **Age:** Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan — typically a century or less. While a changeling can shapeshift to conceal their age, the effects of aging still catch up to them.
* **Alignment:** Changelings hate to be bound in any way, and those who follow the path of the Traveler believe that chaos and change are important aspects of life. Most tend toward pragmatic neutrality as opposed to being concerned with lofty ideals. Few changelings embrace evil.
* **Size:** In their natural forms, changelings average between 5 and 6 feet in height, with a slender build. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Shapechanger:** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.

:   You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.

* **Changeling Instincts:** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.

## Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron[]

(Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 60; Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron)

**Consult your DM before using this version.** It is usually considered unofficial and invalid due to updated material.

Your changeling character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your choice of your Dexterity score or your Intelligence score increases by 1.
* **Age:** Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan — typically a century or less. While a changeling can shapeshift to conceal their age, the effects of aging still catch up to them.
* **Alignment:** Changelings hate to be bound in any way, and those who follow the path of the Traveler believe that chaos and change are important aspects of life. Most tend toward pragmatic neutrality as opposed to being concerned with lofty ideals. Few changelings embrace evil.

* **Change Appearance:** As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.

:   You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.
:   Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Deception check you make to avoid detection.

* **Changeling Instincts:** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
* **Unsettling Visage:** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
* **Divergent Persona:** You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a persona associated with that proficiency: establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.

## Unearthed Arcana[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Eberron)

**Consult your DM before using this version.** It is usually considered unofficial and invalid due to updated material.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Duplicity:** You gain proficiency in the Deception skill.
* **Shapechanger:** As an action, you can polymorph into any humanoid of your size that you have seen, or back into your true form. However, your equipment does not change with you. If you die, you revert to your natural appearance.
