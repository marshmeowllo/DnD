***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Monstrosity.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Chameleon Carapace.*** While you aren't wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Secondary Arms.*** You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property.

***Sleepless.*** You do not require sleep and can remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.

***Thri-kreen Telepathy.*** Without the assistance of magic, you can't speak the non-thri-kreen languages you know. Instead you use telepathy to convey your thoughts. You have the magical ability to transmit your thoughts mentally to willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of yourself. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you to understand your thoughts, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.

***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

***Subrace.*** With your DM's approval, you can choose one of several subraces for your character. These subrace traits replace the Ability Score Increase feature and the Infernal Legacy feature, except the Variant subrace.

### Variant[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 118)

Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.

***Appearance.*** Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4+1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goatlike legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.

***Feral.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait fully replaces the Ability Score Increase trait.

***Devil's Tongue.*** You know the Vicious Mockery cantrip. When your reach 3rd level, you can cast the Charm Person spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Enthrall spell once with this trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells once again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

***Hellfire.*** You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Burning Hands spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

***Winged.*** You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

### Abyssal[]

( Unearthed Arcana: That Old Black Magic])

All abyssal tieflings trace their bloodline to the demons of the Abyss. These tieflings have the following additional features. These features replace the Ability Score Increase, Hellish Resistance, Infernal Legacy, and Languages traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Abyssal Arcana.*** Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd-level spell.

You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-level slot.

At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.

| d6 | 1st-level | 3rd-level | 5th-level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Dancing Lights | Burning Hands | Alter Self |
| 2 | True Strike | Charm Person | Darkness |
| 3 | Light | Magic Missile | Invisibility |
| 4 | Message | Cure Wounds | Levitate |
| 5 | Spare the Dying | Tasha's Hideous Laughter | Mirror Image |
| 6 | Prestidigitation | Thunderwave | Spider Climb |

***Abyssal Fortitude.*** Your hit point maximum increases by half your level (minimum 1).

***Languages.*** Instead of Infernal, you can speak, read, and write Abyssal.

* **Alignment:** Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.
* **Size:** Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium.

:   In Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, your height is 4'10" with a modifier of +2d8. Your weight is 400 lbs. with a modifier of +(height roll).

* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number).

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Control Air and Water.*** You can cast Fog Cloud with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Gust of Wind spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the Water Walk spell with it. Once you cast any of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
