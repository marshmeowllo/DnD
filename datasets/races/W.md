A warforged can come in many different shapes and forms. Some more human-like than others.

 

The **Warforged** are a species of sentient, living robotic beings (mostly) originating from the distant world of Eberron

The designation "Warforged" stems from the species' generally-shared ability to war and to reforge their bodies at will, rearranging their component parts from a robotic primary mode (usually, but not always, humanoid) into an alternate form; generally vehicles, weapons, machinery, or animals. In some continuities this ability to transform is innate to all members of the species, in others it was a wartime innovation that was adopted by most, but not all, of the populace.

Your warforged character has the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** A typical warforged is between two and thirty thousand years old. The maximum lifespan of the warforged remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. With an exception seen due to extreme amounts of nostalgia.

***Alignment.*** Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality, but some have absorbed the morality — or lack thereof — of the beings they served with.

***Size.*** Your size is Huge. Most warforged stand between 5 and 6 1/2 feet tall. Build is affected by your subrace.

You can alter your body to enter different defensive modes; each time you finish a long rest, choose one mode to adopt from the Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode's prerequisite.

| Mode | Prerequisite | Armor Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Darkwood core (unarmored) | None | 11 + your Dexterity modifier (add proficiency bonus if proficient with light armor) |
| Composite plating (armor) | Medium armor proficiency | 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + your proficiency bonus |
| Heavy plating (armor) | Heavy armor proficiency | 16 + your proficiency bonus; disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks |

***Iron Fists.*** When you hit with an unarmed strike, you can deal 2d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the normal damage for an unarmed strike.
