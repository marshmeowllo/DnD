# Reborn

From Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, page 20.

## Traits[]

You have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Ancestral Legacy.*** If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

***Deathless Nature.*** You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:

* You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
* You have advantage on death saving throws.
* You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
* You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.

***Knowledge from a Past Life.*** You temporarily remember sporadic glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Revenant

From Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Heroes.

**Consult your DM before using this race.**

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

The revenant subrace can be applied to any race that has a subrace, and replaces that race's existing subrace options. Alternatively, you can apply this new subrace to a race without subrace options using the modification options provided below.

Your DM might also allow you to take this subrace for a slain character. In that case, your character rises from the dead with its original subrace replaced (or with the necessary modifications made to its base traits), filled with a determination to seek vengeance or complete its mission.

## Contents

* 1 Traits
* 2 Racial Adjustments
  + 2.1 Human Revenant
  + 2.2 Dragonborn Revenant
  + 2.3 Tiefling Revenant

## Traits[]

The following traits replace your subrace's traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
* **Relentless Nature:** Your DM assigns a goal to you — typically, one related to your character's death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:
  + If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.
  + If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.
  + You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

## Racial Adjustments[]

For races that don't have subrace options, taking on the revenant subrace means making changes to your character's base traits, as follows. This article provides options only for human and dragonborn characters. Because half-elves and half-orcs have no subrace options, they shouldn't be used with these revenant subrace rules.

### Human Revenant[]

If you want to play a Human revenant, modify the human's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. If you use the variant human traits, remove the Skills trait and the Feat trait.

### Dragonborn Revenant[]

If you want to play a Dragonborn revenant, modify the dragonborn's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Additionally, your Draconic Ancestry trait uses necrotic damage as its damage type, replacing the damage type that applies to your breath weapon and your damage resistance.

### Tiefling Revenant[]

Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes released several Tiefling variants that make use of subraces. Use the book to make a tiefling revenant, replacing the subrace options with the revenant subrace options.
