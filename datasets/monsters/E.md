# Efreeti

From Monster Manual, page 145.

| Efreeti | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large elemental, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 200 (16d10 + 112)  **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 60 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  22 (+6) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  24 (+7) | **INT**  16 (+3) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  16 (+3) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +7, Wis +6, Cha +7  **Damage Immunities:** fire  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft.  **Languages:** Ignan  **Challenge Rating:** 11 (7,200 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Elemental Demise.*** If the efreeti dies, its body disintegrates in a flash of fire and puff of smoke, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The efreeti's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic  *3/day each:* Enlarge/Reduce, Tongues  *1/day each:* Conjure Elemental (fire elemental only), Gaseous Form, Invisibility, Major Image, Plane Shift, Wall of Fire  ***Variant: Genie Powers.*** Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.   * **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the Disguise Self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the True Polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well. * **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.   To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the Wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The efreeti makes two scimitar attacks or uses its Hurl Flame twice.  ***Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.  ***Hurl Flame.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (5d6) fire damage. | | | | | |

| **STR**  16 (+3) | **DEX**  5 (-3) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  1 (-5) | **WIS**  6 (-2) | **CHA**  1 (-5) |

| ***Amorphous.*** The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  ***Corrosive Form.*** A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.  ***Spider Climb.*** The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |

The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. | | | | | |
| Reactions | | | | | |
| ***Split.*** When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding. | | | | | |

# Elder Brain

From Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 173.

| Elder Brain | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large aberration, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 10 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 210 (20d10 + 100)  **Speed:** 5 ft., swim 10 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  15 (+2) | **DEX**  10 (0) | **CON**  20 (+5) | **INT**  21 (+5) | **WIS**  19 (+4) | **CHA**  24 (+7) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +10, Wis +9, Cha +12  **Skills:** Arcana +10, Deception +12, Insight +14, Intimidation +12, Persuasion +12  **Senses:** blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 14  **Languages:** understands Common, Deep Speech, and Undercommon but can't speak, telepathy 5 miles  **Challenge Rating:** 14 (11,500 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Creature Sense.*** The elder brain is aware of the presence of creatures within 5 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each one's intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a Mind Blank spell, a Nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.  ***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The elder brain's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:  *At will:* Detect Thoughts, Levitate  *1/day each:* Dominate Monster, Plane Shift (self only)  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the elder brain fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The elder brain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Telepathic Hub.*** The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically hear each other while connected in this way. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *:* 20 (4d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and takes 9 (1d8 + 5) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets grappled at a time.  ***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The elder brain magically emits psychic energy. Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Psychic Link.*** The elder brain targets one incapacitated creature it can perceive with its Creature Sense trait and establishes a psychic link with that creature. Until the psychic link ends, the elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once it is no longer incapacitated, and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 5 miles apart, with no consequences to the target. The elder brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.  ***Sense Thoughts.*** The elder brain targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target's reasoning, its emotional state, and thoughts that loom large in its mind (including things the target worries about, loves, or hates). The elder brain can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the elder brain succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The elder brain can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The elder brain regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Tentacle.** The elder brain makes a tentacle attack.  **Break Concentration.** The elder brain targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain breaks the creature's concentration on a spell it has cast. The creature also takes 1d4 psychic damage per level of the spell.  **Psychic Pulse.** The elder brain targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. Enemies of the elder brain within 10 feet of that creature take 10 (3d6) psychic damage.  **Sever Psychic Link.** The elder brain targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain ends the link, causing the creature to have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of the creature's next turn. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| When fighting inside its lair, an elder brain can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an elder brain can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the elder brain can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:   * The elder brain casts Wall of Force. * The elder brain targets one friendly creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. The target has a flash of inspiration and gains advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn. If the target doesn't or can't use this benefit in that time, the inspiration is lost. * The elder brain targets one creature it can sense within 120 feet of it and anchors it by sheer force of will. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be unable to leave its current space. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The territory within 5 miles of an elder brain is altered by the creature's psionic presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Creatures within 5 miles of an elder brain feel as if they are being followed, even when they are not. * The elder brain can overhear any telepathic conversation happening within 5 miles of it. The creature that initiated the telepathic conversation makes a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check when telepathic contact is first established. If the check succeeds, the creature is aware that something is eavesdropping on the conversation. The nature of the eavesdropper isn't revealed, and the elder brain can't participate in the telepathic conversation unless it has formed a psychic link with the creature that initiated it. * Any creature with which the elder brain has formed a psychic link hears faint, incomprehensible whispers in the deepest recesses of its mind. This psychic detritus consists of the elder brain's stray thoughts commingled with those of other creatures to which it is linked.   If the elder brain dies, these effects immediately end. | | | | | |

# Elder Oblex

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 219.

| Elder Oblex | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Huge ooze, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 16  **Hit Points:** 115 (10d12 + 50)  **Speed:** 20 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  15 (+2) | **DEX**  16 (+3) | **CON**  21 (+5) | **INT**  22 (+6) | **WIS**  13 (+1) | **CHA**  18 (+4) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +10, Cha +8  **Skills:** Arcana +10, Deception +8, History +10, Nature +10, Perception +5, Religion +10  **Condition Immunities:** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, prone  **Senses:** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this distance), passive Perception 15  **Languages:** Common plus six more  **Challenge Rating:** 10 (5,900 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Amorphous.*** The oblex can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  ***Aversion to Fire.*** If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The oblex's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:  *At will:* Charm Person (as a 5th-level spell), Detect Thoughts, Hold Person  *3/day each:* Confusion, Dimension Door, Dominate Person, Fear, Hallucinatory Terrain, Hold Monster, Hypnotic Pattern, Telekinesis  ***Ooze Nature.*** The oblex doesn't require sleep.  ***Sulfurous Impersonation.*** As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 2d6 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The elder oblex makes two pseudopod attacks and uses Eat Memories  ***Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage.  ***Eat Memories.*** The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 158 Wisdom saving throw or take 44 (8d10) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the Greater Restoration or Heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends. When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies. | | | | | |

Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. In addition, strong winds swirl in the area covered by the storm. The winds impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. The winds extinguish open flames and disperse fog.  ***Siege Monster.*** The tempest deals double damage to objects and structures. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two attacks with its thunderous slam.  ***Thunderous Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d6 + 9) thunder damage.  ***Lightning Storm (Recharge 6).*** All other creatures within 120 feet of the tempest must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a target's saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The elder tempest can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  **Screaming Gale (Costs 3 Actions).** The tempest releases a blast of thunder and wind in a line that is 1 mile long and 20 feet wide. Objects in that area take 22 (4d10) thunder damage. Each creature there must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) thunder damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with an immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target would collide with another creature instead, that other creature must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. | | | | | |
