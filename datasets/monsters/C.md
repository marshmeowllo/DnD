| ***Fiendish Blessing.*** The AC of the cambion includes its Charisma bonus.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cambion's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14).

Cultists of Baphomet and Orcus can also use foul rituals to infuse their master's strength into a young or unborn child, yielding a cult champion who can wield special abilities; a cambion linked to Orcus replaces Fiendish Charm with Spawn of the Grave, and one linked to Baphomet replaces it with Horned One's Call.   * ***Horned One's Call.*** When the cambion targets only one creature with the attacks of its Multiattack, it can choose one ally it can see within 30 feet. That ally can use its reaction to make one melee attack against a target of its choice. * ***Spawn of the Grave.*** At the end of each of the cambion's turns, each undead of its choice that it can see within 30 feet gains 10 temporary hit points, provided the cambion isn't incapacitated.   In addition, this cambion can use its Innate Spellcasting ability to cast Animate Dead three times per day. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.  ***Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.  ***Fire Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) fire damage.  ***Fiendish Charm.*** One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |

| **Skills:** Stealth +5  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11  **Languages:** Deep Speech, Undercommon  **Challenge Rating:** 8 (3,900 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down). and that creature takes the other half.  ***False Appearance.*** While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.  ***Light Sensitivity.*** While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.  ***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.  ***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.  Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.  A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears. | | | | | |

Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  ***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling.

| ***Nondetection.*** The cat cannot be targeted or detected by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.  ***Pounce.*** If the cat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

If the cat's saving throw succeeds and the spell is of 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on the cat and instead targets the caster. | | | | | |

# Creepy Doll

From Plane Shift: Innistrad, page 25.

| Creepy Doll | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Tiny construct, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 12  **Hit Points:** 21 (6d4 + 6)  **Speed:** 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  6 (-2) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  13 (+1) | **INT**  12 (+1) | **WIS**  11 (0) | **CHA**  10 (0) |
| **Skills:** Stealth +4  **Damage Resistances:** bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  **Damage Immunities:** poison  **Condition Immunities:** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10  **Languages:** speaks and understands the languages known by its creator  **Challenge Rating:** 2 (450 XP) | | | | | |
| ***False Appearance.*** While the creepy doll remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary, inanimate doll. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The creepy doll makes one attack with its scissors and uses Psychic Assault.  ***Scissors.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.  ***Psychic Assault.*** The creepy doll targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6. If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence, as from the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.  ***Body Exchange.*** The creepy doll initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the creepy doll's spirit inhabits the target's body while the target's spirit is placed into the creepy doll's body. The creepy doll controls the target's body completely. It retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The target retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while inhabiting the creepy doll's body.  The body exchange lasts until the doll's spirit is forced out by magic. (The Dispel Evil and Good spell will accomplish this, though the doll is not one of the creature types whose possession that spell normally ends.) The body and the doll must be within 5 feet of each other for such an effect to work. The target is immune to this doll's Body Exchange for 24 hours after winning the Intelligence contest or after the exchange ends. | | | | | |

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Cryovain's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Cryovain exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Cryovain can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

Each creature within 10 feet of Cryovain must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Cryovain can then fly up to half his flying speed. | | | | | |

A creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the golem until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.
