If the enemy's saving throw is successful, it is immune to this colossus's Towering Terror for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |

| ***Multiattack.*** The colossus makes three attacks — one with its slam and two with its eldritch turrets — and then uses Stomp.  ***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (3d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the colossus can push the target up to 20 feet away from it.  ***Eldritch Turret.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +18 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) force damage, and if the the target is a creature, it is knocked prone.  ***Stomp.*** The colossus stomps one of its feet at a point on the ground within 20 feet of it.

| *Medium fey (elf), chaotic neutral* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 19 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 127 (17d8 + 51)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  11 (0) | **DEX**  10 (0) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  18 (+4) | **WIS**  17 (+3) | **CHA**  13 (+1) |

| ***Changeable Nature.*** Whenever the eladrin finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn't incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in its original form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.  ***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Fog Cloud, Gust of Wind  *1/day each:* Cone of Cold, Ice Storm  ***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Sorrowful Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Sorrowful Presence for the next 24 hours.  Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d8) slashing damage, or 5 (1d10) slashing damage if used with two hands.  ***Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d8) piercing damage. | | | | | |
