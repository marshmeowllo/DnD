| **Armor Class:** 12  **Hit Points:** 21 (6d4 + 6)  **Speed:** 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  6 (-2) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  13 (+1) | **INT**  12 (+1) | **WIS**  11 (0) | **CHA**  10 (0) |
| **Skills:** Perception +2, Stealth +4  **Damage Resistances:** bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical attacks  **Condition Immunities:** blinded  **Senses:** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 12  **Languages:** understands Deep Speech but can't speak, telepathy 60 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 2 (450 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Detect Sentience.*** The intellect devourer can sense the presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a Mind Blank spell. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The intellect devourer makes one attack with its claws and uses Devour Intellect.  ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.  ***Devour Intellect.*** The intellect devourer targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.  ***Body Thief.*** The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it that isn't protected by protection from evil and good. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.  If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a Wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round. | | | | | |

| ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Iymrith's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20). Iymrith's stone shape can create a living gargoyle instead of altering the stone as described in the spell description. This transformation is permanent and can't be reversed or dispelled. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *1/day:* Counterspell, Detect Magic, Ice Storm, Stone Shape, Teleport  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Iymrith fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Iymrith can use her Frightful Presence. She then makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Iymrith's choice that is within 120 feet of Iymrith and aware of her must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Iymrith's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Iymrith exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  ***Change Shape.*** Iymrith magically polymorphs into a female Storm Giant or back into her true form. She reverts to her true form if she dies. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Iymrith's choice).  In storm giant form, Iymrith retains her alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Her statistics are otherwise replaced by those of the new form. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Iymrith can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Iymrith regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** Iymrith makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** Iymrith makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Iymrith beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Iymrith can then fly up to half its flying speed. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Iymrith takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Iymrith can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that Iymrith can see within 120 feet of her. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success. * A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Iymrith can see within 120 feet of her. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. * Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that Iymrith can see. They must be within 120 feet of Iymrith and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding Iymrith's lair is warped by Iymrith's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair. * Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an Air Elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5). * Hidden sinkholes form in and around Iymrith's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into the sinkhole.   If Iymrith dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are. | | | | | |
