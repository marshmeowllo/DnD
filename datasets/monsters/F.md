# Flail Snail

From Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 144.

| Flail Snail | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large elemental, unaligned* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 16 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 52 (5d10 + 25)  **Speed:** 10 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  17 (+3) | **DEX**  5 (-3) | **CON**  20 (+5) | **INT**  3 (-4) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  5 (-3) |
| **Damage Immunities:** fire, poison  **Condition Immunities:** poisoned  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 10  **Languages:** —  **Challenge Rating:** 3 (700 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Antimagic Shell.*** The snail has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against the snail has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the snail succeeds on its saving throw against a spell or a spell attack misses it, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a d6:   | d6 | Effect | | --- | --- | | 1-2 | If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only the snail, it has no effect on the snail and is reflected back at the caster, using the spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster. | | 3-4 | No additional effect. | | 5-6 | The snail's shell converts some of the spell's energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet of the snail must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage per level of the spell on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |   ***Flail Tentacles.*** The flail snail has five flail tentacles. Whenever the snail takes 10 damage or more on a single turn, one of its tentacles dies. If even one tentacle remains, the snail regrows all dead ones within 1d4 days. If all its tentacles die, the snail retracts into its shell, gaining total cover, and it begins wailing, a sound that can be heard for 600 feet, stopping only when it dies 5d6 minutes later. Healing magic that restores limbs, such as the regenerate spell, can halt this dying process. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The flail snail makes as many flail tentacle attacks as it has flail tentacles, all against the same target.  ***Flail Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.  ***Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the light ends.  ***Shell Defense.*** The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn. | | | | | |

| ***Aversion of Fire.*** If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.  ***Berserk.*** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. If the golem's creator is within 60 feet of the berserk golem, the creator can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.  ***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.  ***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** The golem's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.  ***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. | | | | | |

| **Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 264 (16d20 + 96)  **Speed:** 40 ft., burrow 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  28 (+9) | **DEX**  8 (-1) | **CON**  22 (+6) | **INT**  1 (-5) | **WIS**  5 (-3) | **CHA**  5 (-3) |

| ***Death Burst.*** When the worm dies, it explodes in a burst of frigid energy. Each creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures inside the worm when it dies automatically fail this saving throw.  ***Freezing Body.*** A creature that touches the worm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.  ***Tunneler.*** The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The worm makes two bite attacks, or uses its Trill and makes a bite attack.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and 10 (3d6) cold damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.  If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm.  ***Trill.*** The frost worm emits a haunting cry. Each creature within 60 feet of the worm that can hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, or if this effect ends for it, that creature is immune to the Trill of all frost worms for the next 24 hours. Frost worms are immune to this effect. | | | | | |
