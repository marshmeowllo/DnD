| ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Yeenoghu's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic  *3/day each:* Dispel Magic, Fear, Invisibility  *1/day:* Teleport  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Yeenoghu fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Yeenoghu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** Yeenoghu's weapon attacks are magical.  ***Rampage.*** When Yeenoghu reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on his turn, Yeenoghu can take a bonus action to move up to half his speed and make a bite attack. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Yeenoghu makes three flail attacks. If an attack hits, he can cause it to create an additional effect of his choice or at random (each effect can be used only once per Multiattack):   1. The attack deals an extra 13 (2d12) bludgeoning damage. 2. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of Yeenoghu's next turn. 3. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the Confusion spell until the start of Yeenoghu's next turn.   ***Flail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (1d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (1d10 + 9) piercing damage. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Yeenoghu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Yeenoghu regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Charge.** Yeenoghu moves up to his speed.  **Swat Away.** Yeenoghu makes a flail attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in a straight line away from Yeenoghu. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls prone.  **Savage (Costs 2 Actions).** Yeenoghu makes a bite attack against each creature within 10 feet of him. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeenoghu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Yeenoghu causes an iron spike - 5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter - to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained condition. * Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to its speed. * Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advantage against them. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing Yeenoghu's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:   * Within 1 mile of the lair, large iron spikes grow out of the ground and stone surfaces. Yeenoghu impales the bodies of the slain on these spikes. * Predatory beasts within 6 miles of the lair become unusually savage, killing far more than what they need for food. Carcasses of prey are left to rot in an unnatural display of wasteful slaughter. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Yeenoghu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Yeenoghu dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Yeenoghu | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Yeenoghu's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Yeenoghu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured.   | d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 01-20 | "I get caught up in the flow of anger, and try to stoke others around me into forming an angry mob." | | 21-40 | "The flesh of other intelligent creatures is delicious!" | | 41-60 | "I rail against the laws and customs of civilization, attempting to return to a more primitive time." | | 61-80 | "I hunger for the deaths of others, and am constantly starting fights in the hope of seeing bloodshed." | | 81-00 | "I keep trophies from the bodies I have slain, turning them into adornments." | | | | | | |

# Yellow Musk Creeper

From Tomb of Annihilation, page 237.

| Yellow Musk Creeper | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium plant, unaligned* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 6  **Hit Points:** 60 (11d8 + 11)  **Speed:** 5 ft., climb 5 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  12 (+1) | **DEX**  3 (-4) | **CON**  12 (+1) | **INT**  1 (-5) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  3 (-4) |
| **Condition Immunities:** blinded, deafened, exhaustion, prone  **Senses:** blindsight 30 ft., passive Perception 10  **Languages:** —  **Challenge Rating:** 2 (450 XP) | | | | | |
| ***False Appearance.*** While the creeper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary flowering vine.  ***Regeneration.*** The creeper regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the creeper takes fire, necrotic, or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The creeper dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) psychic damage. If the target is a humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, it dies and is implanted with a yellow musk creeper bulb. Unless the bulb is destroyed, the corpse animates as a yellow musk zombie after being dead for 24 hours. The bulb is destroyed if the creature is raised from the dead before it can transform into a yellow musk zombie, or if the corpse is targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic before it animates.  ***Yellow Musk (3/Day).*** The creeper's flowers release a strong musk that targets all humanoids within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the creeper for 1 minute. A creature charmed in this way does nothing on its turn except move as close as it can to the creeper. A creature charmed by the creeper can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |

# Yeth Hound

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large fey, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 51 (6d10 + 18)  **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover) | | | | | |
| **STR**  18 (+4) | **DEX**  17 (+3) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  5 (-3) | **WIS**  12 (+1) | **CHA**  7 (-2) |

| ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The yeth hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.  ***Sunlight Banishment.*** If the yeth hound starts its turn in sunlight, it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. While sunlight shines on the spot from which it vanished, the hound must remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it returns to the Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon it typically sets out to find its pack or its master. The hound is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. Once it is adjacent to its master or a pack mate that is on the Material Plane, a yeth hound in the Border Ethereal can return to the Material Plane as an action.  ***Telepathic Bond.*** While the yeth hound is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage if the target is frightened.  ***Baleful Baying.*** The yeth hound bays magically. Every enemy within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the hound's next turn or until the hound is incapacitated. A frightened target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |

# Zuggtmoy

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 157.

| Zuggtmoy | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large fiend (demon), chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 304 (32d10 + 128)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  22 (+6) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  20 (+5) | **WIS**  19 (+4) | **CHA**  24 (+7) |

| ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Zuggtmoy's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic, Locate Animals or Plants, Ray of Sickness  *3/day each:* Dispel Magic, Ensnaring Strike, Entangle, Plant Growth  *1/day each:* Etherealness, Teleport  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zuggtmoy fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Zuggtmoy has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** Zuggtmoy's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Zuggtmoy makes three pseudopod attacks.  ***Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.  ***Infestation Spores (3/Day).*** Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the Spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be.  ***Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5-6).*** Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids and beasts in the cloud when it appears, or that enter it later, must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the Influence of Zuggtmoy for 24 hours. While infected in this way, the creature is charmed by her and can't be reinfected by these spores. | | | | | |
| Reactions | | | | | |
| ***Protective Thrall.*** When Zuggtmoy is hit by an attack, one creature within 5 feet of Zuggtmoy that is charmed by her must use its reaction to be hit by the attack instead. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Zuggtmoy can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Zuggtmoy regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Attack.** Zuggtmoy makes one pseudopod attack.  **Exert Will.** One creature charmed by Zuggtmoy that she can see must use its reaction to move up to its speed as she directs or to make a weapon attack against a target that she designates. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zuggtmoy can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Zuggtmoy causes four gas spores or violet fungi to appear in unoccupied spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish after 1 hour. * Up to four plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggtmoy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack. * Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her Mind Control Spores, centered on a mushroom or other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing Zuggtmoy's lair is warped by her magic, creating one or more of the following effects:   * Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles of the lair, even where they would normally find no purchase. * Plant life within 1 mile of the lair becomes infested with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is overwhelmed. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Zuggtmoy table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Zuggtmoy dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Zuggtmoy | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Zuggtmoy's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.   | d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 01-20 | "I see visions in the world around me that others do not." | | 21-40 | "I periodically slip into a catatonic state, staring off into the distance for long stretches at a time." | | 41-60 | "I see an altered version of reality, with my mind convincing itself that things are true even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary." | | 61-80 | "My mind is slipping away, and my intelligence seems to wax and wane." | | 81-00 | "I am constantly scratching at unseen fungal infections." | | | | | | |
