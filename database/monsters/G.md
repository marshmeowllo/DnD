| **Armor Class:** 13  **Hit Points:** 13 (3d6 + 6)  **Speed:** 0 ft., fly 30 ft. (hover) | | | | | |
| **STR**  3 (-4) | **DEX**  17 (+3) | **CON**  14 (+2) | **INT**  3 (-4) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  7 (-2) |

| ***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the gazer can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.  ***Mimicry.*** The gazer can mimic simple sounds of speech it has heard, in any language. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.  ***Variant: Gazer Familiar.*** Spellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical power, especially those who make a point of bullying and harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly attack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar has the following trait.   * **Familiar.** The gazer can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, provided that the master is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gazer senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.  ***Eye Rays.*** The gazer shoots two of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one or two targets it can see within 60 feet of it:   1. **Dazing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of the gazer's next turn. While the target is charmed in this way, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls. 2. **Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the gazer's next turn. 3. **Frost Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) cold damage. 4. **Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature that is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30 feet directly away from the gazer. If the target is an object weighing 10 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, the gazer moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. The gazer can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a container. | | | | | |

| ***Ooze Cube.*** The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.  A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.  The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.  ***Ooze Nature.*** The cube doesn't require sleep.  ***Transparent.*** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube. | | | | | |

| ***Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) acid damage.  ***Engulf.*** The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.  On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.  An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube. | | | | | |

Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.  ***Gibbering.*** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.  ***Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 17 (5d6) piercing damage.

The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mouther's next turn. | | | | | |

Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic, Detect Thoughts, Invisibility (self only), Mage Hand, Major Image  *2/day each:* Fear, Fireball, Fly, Tongues  *1/day each:* Plane Shift  ***Magic Resistance.*** The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** The slaad's weapon attacks are magical.  ***Regeneration.*** The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.  ***Variant: Control Gem.*** Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.  Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem.

A Wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.  A Greater Restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.  Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad. | | | | | |

Aside from his size, his statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. | | | | | |

| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Graz'zt can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

He needn't see each one, but he must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target that creature. He issues the same command to all the targets. * Smooth surfaces within the lair become as reflective as a polished mirror. Until a different lair action is used, creatures within the lair have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing Graz'zt's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:   * Flat surfaces within 1 mile of the lair that are made of stone or metal become highly reflective, as though polished to a shine. These surfaces become supernaturally mirrorlike. * Wild beasts within 6 miles of the lair break into frequent conflicts and coupling, mirroring the behavior that occurs during their mating seasons. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Graz'zt table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Graz'zt dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Graz'zt | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Graz'zt's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Graz'zt table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured.   | d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 01-20 | "There is nothing in the world more important than me and my desires." | | 21-40 | "Anyone who doesn't do exactly what I say doesn't deserve to live." | | 41-60 | "Mine is the path of redemption. Anyone who says otherwise is intentionally misleading you." | | 61-80 | "I will not rest until I have made someone else mine, and doing so is more important to me than my own life — or the lives of others." | | 81-90 | "My own pleasure is of paramount importance. Everything else, including social graces, is a triviality." | | 91-00 | "Anything that can bring me happiness should be enjoyed immediately. There is no point to saving anything pleasurable for later." | | | | | | |

# Green Hag

From Monster Manual, page 177.

| Green Hag | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium fey, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 82 (11d8 + 33)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  18 (+4) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  13 (+1) | **WIS**  14 (+2) | **CHA**  14 (+2) |
| **Skills:** Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14  **Languages:** Common, Draconic, Sylvan  **Challenge Rating:** 3 (700 XP) or 5 (1,800) when part of a coven | | | | | |
| ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.  ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power. A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.  ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.  A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcsating ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Dancing Lights, Minor Illusion, Vicious Mockery  ***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.  ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:  *1st level (4 slots):* Identify, Ray of Sickness  *2nd level (3 slots):* Hold Person, Locate Object  *3rd level (3 slots):* Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt  *4th level (3 slots):* Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph  *5th level (2 slots):* Contact Other Plane, Scrying  *6th level (1 slot):* Eyebite  For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.  ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.  The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.  ***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her. | | | | | |

# Green Slaad

From Monster Manual, page 277.

| Green Slaad | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large aberration (shapechanger), chaotic neutral* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 16 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 127 (15d10 + 45)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  18 (+4) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  11 (0) | **WIS**  8 (-1) | **CHA**  12 (+1) |
| **Skills:** Arcana +3, Perception +2  **Damage Resistances:** acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder  **Senses:** blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12  **Languages:** Slaad, telepathy 60 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 8 (3,900 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Shapechanger.*** The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic, Detect Thoughts, Mage Hand  *2/day each:* Fear, Invisibility (self only)  *1/day each:* Fireball  ***Magic Resistance.*** The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Regeneration.*** The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.  ***Variant: Control Gem.*** Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.  Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against Imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A Wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.  A Greater Restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.  Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or staff. Alternatively, it uses its Hurl Flame twice.  ***Bite (Slaad Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.  ***Claws (Slaad Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.  ***Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.  ***Hurl Flame.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. | | | | | |

If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch automatically drains aether. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to keep it out of the gremlin's reach.  If the aether-powered device grants any bonus (to attack rolls, damage rolls, Armor Class, and so on), that bonus is reduced by 1. If the device has charges, it loses 1 charge. Otherwise, it stops functioning for 1 round. Left unhindered, a gremlin can completely destroy an aether-powered device. | | | | | |
