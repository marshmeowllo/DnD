| ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Reflective Carapace.*** Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a  magic missle spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.  ***Siege Monster.*** The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.  ***Horns.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Swallow.*** The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.  If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Attack.** The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack.  **Move.** The tarrasque moves up to half its speed.  **Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).** The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow. | | | | | |

# Tridrone

From Monster Manual, page 225.

| Tridrone | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium construct, lawful neutral* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 15 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 15 (3d8 + 3)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  12 (+1) | **DEX**  13 (+1) | **CON**  12 (+1) | **INT**  9 (-1) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  9 (-1) |
| **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 10  **Languages:** Modron  **Challenge Rating:** 1/2 (100 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Axiomatic Mind.*** The tridrone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.  ***Disintegration.*** If the tridrone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.  ***Variant: Rogue Modrons.*** A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. Rogue modrons don't act in accordance with Primus's wishes and directives, breaking laws, disobeying orders, and even engaging in violence. Other modrons hunt down such rogues.  A rogue modron loses the Axiomatic Mind trait and can have any alignment other than lawful neutral. Otherwise, it has the same statistics as a regular modron of its rank. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The tridrone makes three fist attacks or three javelin attacks.  ***Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.  ***Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage. | | | | | |

# Troll

From Monster Manual, page 291.

| Troll | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large giant, chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 15 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 84 (8d10 + 40)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  18 (+4) | **DEX**  13 (+1) | **CON**  20 (+5) | **INT**  7 (-2) | **WIS**  9 (-1) | **CHA**  7 (-2) |
| **Skills** Perception +2  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12  **Languages:** Giant  **Challenge Rating:** 5 (1800 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Keen Smell.*** The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.  ***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.  ***Variant: Loathsome Limbs.*** Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:  **1-10:** Nothing else happens.  **11-14:** One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.  **15-18:** One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.  **19-20:** The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.  If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.  A **severed leg** is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.  A **severed arm** has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.  If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The **severed head** has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.  The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. | | | | | |

These trees understand Druidic and obey Trostani's spoken commands, but can't speak. If she issues no commands to them, the trees do nothing but follow her and take the Dodge action. | | | | | |

| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The quori makes three attacks: one pincer attack, one attack with its claws, and one stinger attack.  ***Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The quori has two pincers, each of which can grapple one target.  ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (4d4 + 3) slashing damage.  ***Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the quori for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.  The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the Dispel Evil and Good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. | | | | | |
