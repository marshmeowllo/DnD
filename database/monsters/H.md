# Halaster Blackcloak

From Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, page 310.

| Halaster Blackcloak | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium humanoid (human), chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14 (17 with mage armor)  **Hit Points:** 246 (29d8 + 116)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  10 (0) | **DEX**  18 (+4) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  24 (+7) | **WIS**  18 (+4) | **CHA**  18 (+4) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +14, Wis +11  **Skills:** Arcana +21, History +21, Perception +11  **Damage Resistances:** fire; lightning (granted by the Blast Scepter, see "Special Equipment" below)  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 21  **Languages:** Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Infernal, Undercommon  **Challenge Rating:** 23 (50,000 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Special Equipment.*** Halaster wears a Robe of Eyes that lets him see in all directions, gives him darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and allows him to see invisible creatures and objects, as well as into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.  Halaster wields a Blast Scepter (a very rare magic item that requires attunement). It can be used as an arcane focus. Whoever is attuned to the Blast Scepter gains resistance to fire and lightning damage and can, as an action, use it to cast Thunderwave as a 4th-level spell (save DC 16) without expending a spell slot.  Halaster also wears a Horned Ring (a very rare magic item that requires attunement), which allows an attuned wearer to ignore Undermountain's magical restrictions.  ***Arcane Recovery (1/Day).*** When he finishes a short rest, Halaster recovers all his spell slots of 5th level and lower.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Halaster's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Disguise Self, Invisibility  *1/day:* Fly, Lightning Bolt  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Halaster fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.  ***Rejuvenation.*** If Halaster dies in Undermountain, he revives after 1d10 days, with all his hit points and any missing body parts restored. His new body appears in a random safe location in Undermountain.  ***Spellcasting.*** Halaster is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). He can cast Disguise Self and Invisibility at will. He can cast Fly and Lightning Bolt once each without expending a spell slot, but can't do so again until he finishes a short or long rest. Halaster has the following wizard spells prepared:  *Cantrips (at will):* Dancing Lights, Fire Bolt, Light, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation  *1st level (4 slots):* Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield, Silent Image  *2nd level (3 slots):* Arcane Lock, Cloud of Daggers, Darkvision, Knock  *3rd level (3 slots):* Counterspell, Dispel Magic, Fireball  *4th level (3 slots):* Confusion, Hallucinatory Terrain, Polymorph  *5th level (3 slots):* Bigby's Hand, Geas, Wall of Force  *6th level (2 slots):* Chain Lightning, Globe of Invulnerability, Programmed Illusion  *7th level (2 slots):* Finger of Death, Symbol, Teleport  *8th level (1 slot):* Maze, Mind Blank  *9th level (1 slot):* Meteor Swarm, Wish | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Blast Scepter.*** Halaster uses his Blast Scepter to cast Thunderwave as a 4th-level spell. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from him must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Halaster Blackcloak can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Halaster Blackcloak regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Cast Spell.** Halaster casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.  **Spell Ward (Costs 2 Actions).** Halaster expends a spell slot of 4th level or lower and gains 5 temporary hit points per level of the slot. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Halaster takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:   * Halaster targets a volume of unoccupied space or solid stone no larger than four 10-foot cubes within 30 feet of him, turning the open space to solid, worked stone or vice versa. * Halaster causes one door or archway within 30 feet of him to disappear and be replaced by a blank wall, or he restores a door or an archway previously removed in this way. * Halaster deactivates or reactivates one of Undermountain's magic gates. The gate must be within 120 feet of him. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| When Halaster is in Undermountain, the following effects can occur in any location within the dungeon or in any extraplanar extension of the dungeon:   * A magical Scrying sensor appears, taking the form of a ghostly, 1-foot-diameter humanoid eye surrounded by motes of light. The sensor is stationary, though Halaster can reorient the eye to face in any direction. Halaster can see through the eye as though he was in its space. The eye can't be harmed or dispelled, but it winks out within an Antimagic Field. A scrying eye lasts until Halaster ends the effect (no action required). * A minor illusory effect is triggered, as though Halaster had cast Minor Illusion in an area. Common illusions include the echo of rattling chains, the distant sound of explosive spells being cast, a dusty cloak or a rusty helm floating as though worn by an invisible figure, and illusory footprints appearing on a dusty floor. * Silent apparitions of dead adventurers drift through halls and rooms as though they are lost. An apparition can't be harmed, and it doesn't acknowledge creatures or objects in any way. It can't be dispelled but is suppressed within an Antimagic Field. | | | | | |

| *Medium aberration, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 99 (18d8 + 18)  **Speed:** 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  12 (+1) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  13 (+1) | **INT**  18 (+4) | **WIS**  16 (+3) | **CHA**  18 (+4) |

| ***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The quori's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:  *At will:* Charm Person  *3/day each:* Detect Thoughts, Disguise Self, Suggestion  *1/day:* Dominate Person, Dream | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The quori uses its Mind Thrust twice.  ***Idyllic Touch.** Melee Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone in a fit of laughter.  ***Mind Thrust.*** The quori targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  ***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.  The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. | | | | | |

| ***Empathic Feedback.*** When the quori takes damage from a creature it can see within 60 feet of it, the quori can force that creature to succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. | | | | | |

| ***Immutable Form.*** The hellfire engine is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The hellfire engine has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Fleshing-Crushing Stride.*** The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage.  If the hellfire engine remains in the prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer restrained.  ***Hellfire Weapons.*** The hellfire engine uses one of the following options:   * **Bonemelt Sprayer** The hellfire engine spews acidic flame in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) fire damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (1d10) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage at the end of their turns. An affected creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can take an action to scrape off the burning fuel. * **Lightning Flail** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) lightning damage. Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * **Thunder Cannon** The hellfire engine targets a point within 120 feet of it that it can see. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.   If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a Wish spell or killing the lemure and casting True Resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect. | | | | | |

| ***Aura of Invulnerability.*** An invisible aura forms a 10-foot-radius sphere around the hollyphant for as long as it lives. Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells. The hollyphant can use an action to suppress this trait until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hollyphant's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Light  *2/day each:* Bless, Cure Wounds, Protection From Evil and Good  *1/day each:* Banishment, Heal, Raise Dead, Shapechange (into a golden-furred mammoth with feathered wings and a flying speed of 120 ft.), Teleport (with no chance of error)  ***Magic Weapons.*** The hollyphant's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Tusks.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) piercing damage.  ***Trumpet (3/Day).*** The hollyphant blows air through its trunk, creating a trumpet sound that can be heard out to a range of 600 feet. The trumpet also creates a 30-foot cone of energy that has one of the following effects, chosen by the hollyphant:   * **Trumpet of Blasting.** Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 (5d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Nonmagical objects in the cone that aren't being held or worn take 35 (10d6) thunder damage. * **Trumpet of Sparkles.** Creatures in the cone must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d8 + 4) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Evil creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw. Good creatures in the cone take no damage. | | | | | |
