# Nabassu

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 135.

| **STR**  22 (+6) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  21 (+5) | **INT**  14 (+2) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  17 (+3) |

| ***Demonic Shadows.*** The nabassu darkens the area around its body in a 10-foot radius. Nonmagical light can't illuminate this area of dim light.  ***Devour Soul.*** A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of hit dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of hit dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 hit dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a Wish spell.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** The nabassu's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The nabassu uses its Soul-Stealing Gaze and makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.  ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage.  ***Soul-Stealing Gaze.*** The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nabassu and isn't a construct or an undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 13 (2d12) damage and give the nabassu an equal number of temporary hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a ghoul under the nabassu's control. | | | | | |

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.  ***Teleport.*** The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.  ***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. | | | | | |

The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Tongue Lash.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.  ***Siphon Life (Recharge 4-6).*** The nergaliid magically draws the life from a humanoid it can see within 40 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. An incapacitated target fails the save automatically. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the nergaliid gains temporary hit points equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the nergaliid doesn't gain temporary hit points. If this damage kills the target, its body rises at the end of the nergaliid's current turn as a husk zombie. | | | | | |

# Night Hag

From Monster Manual, page 178.

| Night Hag | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium fiend, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 112 (15d8 + 45)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  18 (+4) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  16 (+3) | **WIS**  14 (+2) | **CHA**  16 (+3) |
| **Skills:** Deception +7, Insight +6, Perception +6, Stealth +6  **Damage Resistances:** cold, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered  **Condition Immunities:** charmed  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16  **Languages:** Abyssal, Common, Infernal, Primordial  **Challenge Rating:** 5 (1,800 XP) or 7 (2,900 XP) when part of a coven | | | | | |
| ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.  A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.  ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.  A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic, Magic Missile  *2/day each:* Plane Shift (self only), Ray of Enfeeblement, Sleep  ***Magic Resistance.*** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Night Hag Items.*** A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself. If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.   * ***Heartstone.*** This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days. * ***Soul Bag.*** When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).   ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:  *1st level (4 slots):* Identify, Ray of Sickness  *2nd level (3 slots):* Hold Person, Locate Object  *3rd level (3 slots):* Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt  *4th level (3 slots):* Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph  *5th level (2 slots):* Contact Other Plane, Scrying  *6th level (1 slot):* Eyebite  For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Claws (Hag Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.  ***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.  ***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.  ***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A Protection From Evil and Good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a Magic Circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic. | | | | | |

# Null

From Plane Shift: Zendikar, page 28.

When a vampire who is not a bloodchief drains the blood from a living humanoid, that creature undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a stronger, faster version of a zombie called a null. Nulls' heads are featureless except for a gaping mouth filled with jagged teeth. Their bodies are shriveled and distorted, but preternaturally strong. They are mindlessly loyal servants to the vampire nobility, and the number of nulls under a vampire's control is a mark of status and power among the vampire houses of Guul Draz.

The stat block for a zombie is provided below. The extent to which a null is stronger and faster is up to a DM.

| Null | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Armor Class:** 8  **Hit Points:** 22 (3d8 + 9)  **Speed:** 20 ft. | | | | | |

| ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the null to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the null drops to 1 hit point instead. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. | | | | | |
