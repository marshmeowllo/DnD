# Red Slaad

From Monster Manual, page 276.

| Red Slaad | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large aberration, chaotic neutral* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 93 (11d10 + 33)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  16 (+3) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  6 (-2) | **WIS**  6 (-2) | **CHA**  7 (-2) |
| **Skills:** Perception +1  **Damage Resistances:** acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11  **Languages:** Slaad, telepathy 60 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 5 (1,800 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Magic Resistance.*** The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Regeneration.*** The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.  ***Variant: Control Gem.*** Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.  Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against Imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A Wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.  A Greater Restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.  Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.  ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease — a minuscule slaad egg.  A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.  If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated. | | | | | |

# Redcap

From Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 188.

| Redcap | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Small fey, chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 13 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 45 (6d6 + 24)  **Speed:** 25 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  18 (+4) | **DEX**  13 (+1) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  10 (0) | **WIS**  12 (+1) | **CHA**  9 (-1) |
| **Skills:** Athletics +6, Perception +3  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13  **Languages:** Common, Sylvan  **Challenge Rating:** 3 (700 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Iron Boots.*** While moving, the redcap has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  ***Outsize Strength.*** While grappling, the redcap is considered to be Medium. Also, wielding a heavy weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on its attack rolls.  ***Variant: Madcap.*** A madcap is a redcap that soaks its hat in demon ichor instead of blood. Contact with demon ichor makes the creature even more psychotic, causing it to brood over irrational hatreds. A group of madcaps will sometimes band together over a shared hatred of something, such as music, creatures with curly hair, the word "cool," or the color blue.  When a madcap drops to 0 hit points, its hateful existence comes to an end in spectacular fashion as it bursts into flames, reducing itself, its ichor-soaked hat, and its pants to ashes instantly while leaving behind its weapon and smoldering iron boots. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The redcap makes three attacks with its wicked sickle.  ***Wicked Sickle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.  ***Ironbound Pursuit.*** The redcap moves up to its speed to a creature it can see and kicks with its iron boots. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. | | | | | |

| ***Amphibious.*** The aboleth can breathe air and water.  ***Mucous Cloud.*** While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.  ***Probing Telepathy.*** If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.  ***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.  ***Enslave (3/Day).*** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.  Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) piercing damage.  ***Eye Rays.*** The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:   1. **Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature. 2. **Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 3. **Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. **Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 5. **Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 6. **Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction.

If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container. 7. **Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead. 8. **Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. 9. **Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it. 10. **Death Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The reduced-threat beholder can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

# Reduced-Threat Monsters

From Tales From the Yawning Portal, page 113.

A reduced-threat monster uses a normal monster's statistics, but it has half the normal hit point maximum and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs.

A reduced-threat creature that is based on a creature bigger than Large is instead Large. Some specific reduced-threat creatures also make changes to the abilities they can use. A reduced-threat creature is worth half the normal XP earned for defeating it.

While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.  ***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** The vrock emits a horrific screech.

A vrock has a 30 percent chance of summoning 2d4 dretches or one vrock.  A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. | | | | | |

Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  ***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone. | | | | | |

The creature has disadvantage on the save if it's within 30 feet of six or more rutterkins. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Crippling Fear of all rutterkins for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature is restrained. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |

| ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned. At the end of each long rest, the poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while poisoned in this way, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a Wish spell. | | | | | |
