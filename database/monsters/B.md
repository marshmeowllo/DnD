| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 114 (12d10 + 48)  **Speed:** 25 ft., climb 25 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  17 (+3) | **DEX**  8 (-1) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  6 (-2) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  8 (-1) |

| ***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the balhannoth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The balhannoth makes a bite attack and up to two tentacle attacks, or it makes up to four tentacle attacks.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (4d10 + 3) piercing damage.  ***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) and is moved up to 5 feet toward the balhannoth. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the balhannoth can't use this tentacle against other targets. The balhannoth has four tentacles. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The balhannoth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The balhannoth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Bite Attack.** The balhannoth makes one bite attack against one creature it has grappled.  **Teleport.** The balhannoth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying and any creatures it has grappled, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.  **Vanish.** The balhannoth magically becomes invisible for up to 10 minutes or until immediately after it makes an attack roll. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| When fighting inside its lair, a balhannoth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the balhannoth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:   * The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can't create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or uses this lair action again. * The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth's choice within 60 feet of it. * The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the balhannoth becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing a balhannoth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Creatures within 1 mile of the balhannoth's lair experience a sensation of being close to whatever they desire most. The sensation grows stronger the closer the creatures come to the balhannoth's lair. * The balhannoth can sense the strongest desires of any humanoid within 1 mile of it and learns whether those desires involve a place: a safe location to rest, a temple, home, or somewhere else.   If the balhannoth dies, these effects end immediately. | | | | | |

The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.  ***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** The balor's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword and one with its whip.  ***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage.

A balor has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d8 vrocks, 1d6 hezrous, 1d4 glabrezus, 1d3 nalfeshnees, 1d2 mariliths, or one goristro.  A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. | | | | | |

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Baphomet's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic  *3/day each:* Dispel Magic, Dominate Beast, Hunter's Mark, Maze, Wall of Stone  *1/day:* Teleport  ***Labyrinthine Recall.*** Baphomet can perfectly recall any path he has traveled, and he is immune to the Maze spell.  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Baphomet fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Baphomet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** Baphomet's weapon attacks are magical.  ***Reckless.*** At the start of his turn, Baphomet can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until the start of his next turn. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Baphomet makes three attacks: one with Heartcleaver, one with his bite, and one with his gore attack.  ***Heartcleaver.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (2d10 + 10) slashing damage.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d8 + 10) piercing damage.  ***Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d6 + 10) piercing damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of the creature.  If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends on it, the creature is immune to Baphomet's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Baphomet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Baphomet regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Heartcleaver Attack.** Baphomet makes a melee attack with Heartcleaver.  **Charge (Costs 2 Actions).** Baphomet moves up to his speed, then makes a gore attack. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet creates this effect again. * Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he's in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it. * Baphomet casts Mirage Arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing Baphomet's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:   * Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes. * Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frightened and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Baphomet table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Baphomet | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Baphomet's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Baphomet table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured.   | d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 01-20 | "My anger consumes me. I can't be reasoned with when my rage has been stoked." | | 21-40 | "I degenerate into beastly behavior, seeming more like a wild animal than a thinking being." | | 41-60 | "The world is my hunting ground. Others are my prey." | | 61-80 | "Hate comes easily to me and explodes into rage." | | 81-00 | "I see those who oppose me not as people, but as beasts meant to be preyed upon." | | | | | | |

| ***Petrifying Gaze.*** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze. | | | | | |

# Behir

From Monster Manual, page 25.

| Behir | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Huge monstrosity, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 168 (16d12 + 64)  **Speed:** 50 ft., climb 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  23 (+6) | **DEX**  16 (+3) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  7 (-2) | **WIS**  14 (+2) | **CHA**  12 (+1) |
| **Skills:** Perception +6, Stealth +7  **Damage Immunities:** lightning  **Senses:** darkvision 90 ft., passive Perception 16  **Languages:** Draconic  **Challenge Rating:** 11 (7,200 XP) | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage  ***Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.  ***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  ***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone. | | | | | |

# Beholder

From Monster Manual, page 28.

| Beholder | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large aberration, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 180 (19d10 + 76)  **Speed:** 0 ft., fly 20 ft. (hover) | | | | | |
| **STR**  10 (0) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  17 (+3) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  17 (+3) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +8, Wis +7, Cha +8  **Skills:** Perception +12  **Condition Immunities:** prone  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 22  **Languages:** Deep Speech, Undercommon  **Challenge Rating:** 13 (10,000 XP) or 14 (11,500 XP) when encountered in lair | | | | | |
| ***Antimagic Cone.*** The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the Antimagic Field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) piercing damage.  ***Eye Rays.*** The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:   1. **Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature. 2. **Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 3. **Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. **Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 5. **Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 6. **Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container. 7. **Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead. 8. **Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic. 9. **Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it. 10. **Death Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The beholder regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Eye Ray.** The beholder uses one random eye ray. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:   * A 50-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round. * Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. * An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.   The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing a beholder's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched when they aren't. * When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person.   If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |

# Belashyrra

From Eberron: Rising From the Last War, page 286.

| Belashyrra | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium aberration, chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 19 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 304 (32d8 + 160)  **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover) | | | | | |

| ***Alien Mind.*** If a creature tries to read Belashyrra's thoughts or deals psychic damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Eye Thief.*** Belashyrra can see through the eyes of all creatures within 120 feet of it. It can use its Eye Ray through any creature within 120 feet of it, as though it were in that creature's space.  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Belashyrra fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Belashyrra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Regeneration.*** Belashyrra regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. Belashyrra dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.  ***Teleport.*** As a bonus action, Belashyrra can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Belashyrra makes two attacks with its claws and uses its Eye Ray once.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage.  ***Eye Ray.*** Belashyrra shoots one of the following magical eye rays of its choice, targeting one creature it can see within 120 feet of it:   1. **Psyche-Reconstruction Ray.** The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, taking 49 (9d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies and transforms into a spectator under Belashyrra's control and acts immediately after Belashyrra in the initiative order. The target can't be returned to its original form by any means short of a Wish spell. 2. **Domination Ray.** The target must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Belashyrra for 1 minute or until the target takes damage. Belashyrra can issue telepathic commands to the charmed creature (no action required), which it does its best to obey. 3. **Mind-Weakening Ray.** The target must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or take 36 (8d8) psychic damage and be unable to cast spells or activate magic items for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. **Blinding Ray.** The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 19 (3d12) radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute. Until this blindness ends, Belyshyrra can see through the blinded creature's eyes. The blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Belashyrra can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Belashyrra regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Claw.** Belashyrra makes one claw attack.  **Implant Fear (Costs 2 Actions).** Belashyrra targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage and immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from Belashyrra.  **Rend Reality (Costs 3 Actions).** Belashyrra rips at the bonds of reality in its immediate area. Each creature within 10 feet of Belashyrra must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 19 (3d12) force damage and gain one level of exhaustion. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| While within the Citadel of Lidless Eyes, Belashyrra can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Belashyrra can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of Belashyrra. One random eye ray of Belashyrra's shoots from that eye at a target of Belashyrra's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears. * Belashyrra creates a wave of madness. Each creature it can see within its lair must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, a creature must use its action at the start of its turn before moving to make a melee attack against another creature of Belashyrra's choice within reach. If there are no creatures within reach, the charmed creature can act normally for that turn. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. * Belashyrra taps into the eyesight of creatures in its lair and alters their perception. Each creature of Belashyrra's choice in the lair must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the affected creature perceives objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations, imposing disadvantage on the creature's attack rolls against those targets. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this lair action for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| Belashyrra's lair is known to touch remote areas of the Shadow Marches and caverns below Xen'drik. A region containing a passage to Belashyrra's lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Creatures within 1 mile of the passage sometimes feel as if they're being watched. * Beasts that live within 5 miles of the passage undergo magical transmutation, growing eyes or eyestalks that Belashyrra can see through. * A humanoid who spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see "Madness of Belashyrra"). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Belashyrra dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Belashyrra | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Belashyrra's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Belashyrra table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured.   | d6 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 1 | I constantly see shapes moving in the shadows. | | 2 | I perceive certain types of people — vocations or entire societies — as hideous monsters. | | 3 | Someone is watching everything I do. | | 4 | When I close my eyes, I see my past misdeeds. | | 5 | I don't trust my sight. I have no idea what's real and what's a hallucination. | | 6 | Something watches the world through my eyes. To thwart them, I keep my eyes closed or covered. | | | | | | |

# Bheur Hag

From Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 160.

| Bheur Hag | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium fey, chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 91 (14d8 + 20)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  13 (+1) | **DEX**  16 (+3) | **CON**  14 (+2) | **INT**  12 (+1) | **WIS**  13 (+1) | **CHA**  16 (+3) |
| **Saving Throws:** Wis +4  **Skills:** Nature +4, Perception +4, Stealth +6, Survival +4  **Damage Immunities:** cold  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14  **Languages:** Auran, Common, Giant  **Challenge Rating:** 7 (2,300 XP) or 9 (3,900 XP) when part of a coven | | | | | |
| ***Graystaff Magic.*** The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.  ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.  A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.  ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.  A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.  ***Ice Walk.*** The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra moment.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Hold Person\*, Ray of Frost  *3/day each:* Cone of Cold\*, Ice Storm\*, Wall of Ice\*  *1/day each: Control Weather*  ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:  *1st level (4 slots):* Identify, Ray of Sickness  *2nd level (3 slots):* Hold Person, Locate Object  *3rd level (3 slots):* Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt  *4th level (3 slots):* Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph  *5th level (2 slots):* Contact Other Plane, Scrying  *6th level (1 slot):* Eyebite  For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.  ***Variant: Death Coven.*** For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the following spells:  *1st level (4 slots):* False Life, Inflict Wounds  *2nd level (3 slots):* Gentle Repose, Ray of Enfeeblement  *3rd level (3 slots):* Animate Dead, Revivify, Speak With Dead  *4th level (3 slots):* Blight, Death Ward  *5th level (2 slots):* Contagion, Raise Dead  *6th level (1 slot):* Circle of Death  ***Variant: Nature Coven.*** For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the following spells:  *1st level (4 slots):* Entangle, Speak With Animals  *2nd level (3 slots):* Flaming Sphere, Moonbeam, Spike Growth  *3rd level (3 slots):* Call Lightning, Plant Growth  *4th level (3 slots):* Dominate Beast, Grasping Vine  *5th level (2 slots):* Insect Plague, Tree Stride  *6th level (1 slot):* Wall of Thorns  ***Variant: Prophecy Coven.*** For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the following spells:  *1st level (4 slots):* Bane, Bless  *2nd level (3 slots):* Augury, Detect Thoughts  *3rd level (3 slots):* Clairvoyance, Dispel Magic, Nondetection  *4th level (3 slots):* Arcane Eye, Locate Creature  *5th level (2 slots):* Geas, Legend Lore  *6th level (1 slot):* True Seeing | | | | | |

| ***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.  ***Maddening Feast.*** The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |

| ***Magic Resistance.*** The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Regeneration.*** The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.  ***Variant: Control Gem.*** Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.  Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against Imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A Wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.  A Greater Restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.  Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a Wish spell can reverse the transformation. | | | | | |

If targeted by Dispel Magic, the broom must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.  ***Constructed Nature.*** The broom doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates the broom is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. If the broom is reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.  ***False Appearance.*** While the broom remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal broom.  ***Flying Broom.*** Some brooms of animated attack allow their creators to ride them, in which case they behave like typical Broom of Flying. A broom of animated attack, however, can carry only half the weight that a broom of flying can. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |

# Burney the Barber

| Burney the Barber | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Gargantuan dragon, chaotic good* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 21  **Hit Points:** 350 (20d20 + 140)  **Speed:** 40 ft., climb 40 ft., fly 80 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  27 (+8) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  25 (+7) | **INT**  20 (+5) | **WIS**  17 (+3) | **CHA**  19 (+4) |

| ***Bahamut's Blessings.*** Burney has received several blessings in her service to Bahamut:   * Unless Burney decided otherwise, once any creature less powerful than a deity has taken three steps from her, they can no longer remember her or having interacted with her specifically. * Burney is under the effect of a permanent Mind Blank spell, and cannot be detected by magical or mundane means unless she wishes it. In exchange for this blessing, Burney can take no direct action against the denizens of the Nine Hells, though she can certainly enlist the help of those who can. * Burney always knows the location of the Wandering Emporium and can transport herself there as though by a Word of Recall spell. This explains why Burney simply seems to appear amid the fully deployed marketplace each morning it is active to provide service and tell stories. * Once each day, when Burney so desires, she can instantly transport herself to the court of Bahamut via a powerful blessing akin to the Plane Shift spell.   ***Healer.*** Burney has the benefits of the Healer feat as well as proficiency with both the healer's kit and the herbalism kit.  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Burney fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Burney can use her Frightful Presence. She then makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Burney's choice that is within 120 feet of Burney and aware of her must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Burney's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** Burney uses one of the following breath weapons:   * **Acid Breath.** Burney exhales acid in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * **Slowing Breath.** Burney exhales gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.   ***Change Shape.*** Burney magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than her own, or back into her true form. She reverts to her true form if she dies. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Burney's choice).  In a new form, Burney retains her alignment, hit points, hit dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Her statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Burney can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Burney regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** Burney makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** Burney makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Burney beats her wings. Each creature within 15 feet of Burney must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Burney can then fly up to half her flying speed. | | | | | |
