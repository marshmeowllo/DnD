# Marid

From Monster Manual, page 146.

| Marid | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large elemental, chaotic neutral* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 229 (17d10 + 136)  **Speed:** 30 ft., fly 60 ft., swim 90 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  22 (+6) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  26 (+8) | **INT**  18 (+4) | **WIS**  17 (+3) | **CHA**  18 (+4) |
| **Saving Throws:** Dex +5, Wis +7, Cha +8  **Damage Resistances:** acid, cold, lightning  **Senses:** blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13  **Languages:** Aquan  **Challenge Rating:** 11 (7,200 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Amphibious.*** The marid can breathe air and water.  ***Elemental Demise.*** If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.  ***Spellcasting.*** The marid's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *Cantrips (at will):* Create or Destroy Water, Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, Fog Cloud, Purify Food and Drink  *3/day each:* Tongues, Water Breathing, Water Walk  *1/day each:* Conjure Elemental (Water Elemental only), Control Water, Gaseous Form, Invisibility, Plane Shift  ***Variant: Genie Powers.** Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.*   * **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the Disguise Self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the True Polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well. * **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.   To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the Wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks.  ***Trident.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage, or 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.  ***Water Jet.*** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21(6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed or knocked prone. | | | | | |

If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the marilith can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the marilith can't make tail attacks against other targets.  ***Teleport.*** The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.  ***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.  A marilith has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d6 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous, 1d3 glabrezus, 1d2 nalfeshnees, or one marilith.  A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. | | | | | |
| Reactions | | | | | |
| ***Parry.*** The marilith adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the marilith must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon. | | | | | |

# Meenlock

From Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 170.

| Meenlock | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Small fey, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 15 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 31 (7d6 + 7)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  7 (-2) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  12 (+1) | **INT**  11 (0) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  8 (-1) |
| **Skills:** Perception +4, Stealth +6, Survival +2  **Condition Immunities:** frightened  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 14  **Languages:** telepathy 120 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 2 (450 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Fear Aura.*** Any beast or humanoid that starts its turn within 10 feet of the meenlock must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the creature's next turn.  ***Light Sensitivity.*** While in bright light, the meenlock has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  ***Shadow Teleport (Recharge 5-6).*** As a bonus action, the meenlock can teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of it, provided that both the space it's teleporting from and its destination are in dim light or darkness. The destination need not be within line of sight.  ***Telepathic Torment.*** Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one incapacitated creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds and dreadful imagery. Participating meenlocks can't use their telepathy for any other purpose during this time, though they can move about and take actions and reactions as normal. This torment has no effect on a creature that is immune to the frightened condition. If the creature is susceptible and remains incapacitated for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment for the entire duration. The process can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM's control. Only a Wish spell or divine intervention can restore a transformed creature to its former state. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |

| ***Amphibious.*** The morkoth can breathe air and water.  ***Spellcasting.*** The morkoth is an 11th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The morkoth has the following wizard spells prepared:  *Cantrips (at will):* Acid Splash, Mage Hand, Mending, Ray of Frost, Shocking Grasp  *1st level (4 slots):* Detect Magic, Identify, Shield, Witch Bolt  *2nd level (3 slots):* Darkness, Detect Thoughts, Shatter  *3rd level (3 slots):* Dispel Magic, Lightning Bolt, Sending  *4th level (3 slots):* Dimension Door, Evard's Black Tentacles  *5th level (3 slots):* Geas, Scrying  *6th level (1 slot):* Chain Lightning | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The morkoth makes three attacks: two with its bite and one with its tentacles or three with its bite.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.  ***Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends. the target is restrained and takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the morkoth's turns. and the morkoth can't use its tentacles on another target.  ***Hypnosis.*** The morkoth projects a 30-foot cone of magical energy. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the morkoth for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the target tries to get as close to the morkoth as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the morkoth. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the morkoth's Hypnosis for 24 hours. | | | | | |
| Reactions | | | | | |
| ***Spell Reflection.*** If the morkoth makes a successful saving throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the morkoth can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 120 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the morkoth. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the morkoth takes a lair action to cause one of the effects described below:   * The morkoth uses its Hypnosis action, originating at a point within 120 feet of itself. It doesn't need to see the effect's point of origin. * The morkoth casts Darkness, Dispel Magic, or Misty Step, using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability and without expending a spell slot. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The island surrounding a morkoth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, creating the following effects:   * The morkoth is aware of any new arrival, whether an object or a creature, on its island or in its sanctum. As an action, the morkoth can locate any one creature or object on the island. Visitors to the island feel as though they are being watched, even when they aren't. * Each time a creature that has been on the island for less than a year finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a failure, the creature has misplaced one possession (chosen by the player, if the creature is that player's character). The possession remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be recovered with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. An object that is misplaced but not recovered ends up in the morkoth's lair 1 hour later. If the creature later goes to the morkoth's lair, its lost possessions stand out in its perception and are easily recovered. * Entrances to the morkoth's lair have an enchantment that the morkoth can activate or suppress at any time while it's in its lair and not incapacitated. Any creature within 30 feet of such an entrance and able to see it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature feels an intense urge to use its movement on each of its turns to enter the lair and to move toward the morkoth's location (the target doesn't realize it's heading toward a creature). The target moves toward the morkoth by the most direct route. As soon as it can see the morkoth, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. It can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and every time it takes damage. * With a thought (no action required), the morkoth can initiate a change in the water within its lair that takes effect 1 minute later. The water can be as breathable and clear as air, or it can be normal water (ranging in clarity from murky to clear).   If the morkoth dies, these regional effects end immediately. | | | | | |

The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight. | | | | | |
| ***Variant: Zuggtmoy's Empowerment.*** *from Out of the Abyss, page 228.*  Myconids that embrace Zuggtmoy can develop new, more destructive kinds of spores. Myconid adults can have two of the following spore effects.   * ***Caustic Spores (1/Day).*** The myconid releases spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature inside the cone must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of each of the myconid's turns.

Other creatures in that area must each succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution modifier + the myconid's proficiency bonus. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on itself on a success. When the effect ends on it, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. | | | | | |

The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Rapport Spores.*** A 20-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour. | | | | | |

The corpse stays animated for 1d4 + 1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.  ***Hallucination Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Pacifying Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Rapport Spores.*** A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour. | | | | | |
