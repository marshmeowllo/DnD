# Zuggtmoy

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 157.

| Zuggtmoy | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large fiend (demon), chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 304 (32d10 + 128)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  22 (+6) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  20 (+5) | **WIS**  19 (+4) | **CHA**  24 (+7) |

| ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Zuggtmoy's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic, Locate Animals or Plants, Ray of Sickness  *3/day each:* Dispel Magic, Ensnaring Strike, Entangle, Plant Growth  *1/day each:* Etherealness, Teleport  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zuggtmoy fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Zuggtmoy has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** Zuggtmoy's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Zuggtmoy makes three pseudopod attacks.  ***Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.  ***Infestation Spores (3/Day).*** Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the Spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be.  ***Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5-6).*** Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids and beasts in the cloud when it appears, or that enter it later, must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the Influence of Zuggtmoy for 24 hours. While infected in this way, the creature is charmed by her and can't be reinfected by these spores. | | | | | |
| Reactions | | | | | |
| ***Protective Thrall.*** When Zuggtmoy is hit by an attack, one creature within 5 feet of Zuggtmoy that is charmed by her must use its reaction to be hit by the attack instead. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Zuggtmoy can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Zuggtmoy regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Attack.** Zuggtmoy makes one pseudopod attack.  **Exert Will.** One creature charmed by Zuggtmoy that she can see must use its reaction to move up to its speed as she directs or to make a weapon attack against a target that she designates. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zuggtmoy can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Zuggtmoy causes four gas spores or violet fungi to appear in unoccupied spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish after 1 hour. * Up to four plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggtmoy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack. * Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her Mind Control Spores, centered on a mushroom or other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing Zuggtmoy's lair is warped by her magic, creating one or more of the following effects:   * Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles of the lair, even where they would normally find no purchase. * Plant life within 1 mile of the lair becomes infested with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is overwhelmed. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Zuggtmoy table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Zuggtmoy dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Zuggtmoy | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Zuggtmoy's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.   | d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 01-20 | "I see visions in the world around me that others do not." | | 21-40 | "I periodically slip into a catatonic state, staring off into the distance for long stretches at a time." | | 41-60 | "I see an altered version of reality, with my mind convincing itself that things are true even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary." | | 61-80 | "My mind is slipping away, and my intelligence seems to wax and wane." | | 81-00 | "I am constantly scratching at unseen fungal infections." | | | | | | |
