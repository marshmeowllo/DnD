| **Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 161 (19d8 + 76)  **Speed:** 30 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover) | | | | | |
| **STR**  12 (+1) | **DEX**  21 (+5) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  23 (+6) | **WIS**  24 (+7) | **CHA**  25 (+7) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +12, Wis +13, Cha +13  **Skills:** Deception +13, Perception +13, Persuasion +13  **Damage Resistances:** cold, necrotic, poison, psychic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  **Condition Immunities:** blinded, charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained  **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 23  **Languages:** all, telepathy 120 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 19 (22,000 XP) | | | | | |
| ***All-Around Vision.*** The quori can't be surprised while it isn't incapacitated.  ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The quori can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.  ***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The quori's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:  *At will:* Arcane Eye  *3/day each:* Clairvoyance, Confusion, Dream, Eyebite  ***Magic Resistance.*** The quori has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The quori makes two Soul Binding attacks. Alternatively, it can make four attacks with Arcane Blast.  ***Arcane Blast.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d10 + 7) force damage.  ***Soul Binding.** Melee Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) necrotic damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this attack dies and has its soul imprisoned in one of the quori's eyes. The target can't be revived by any means short of a Wish spell until the quori is destroyed.  ***Mind Seed (1/Day).*** The quori touches one humanoid, which must succeed on a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed. The curse lasts until it's removed by a Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell.  The cursed target suffers 1 level of exhaustion every 24 hours, and finishing a long rest doesn't reduce its exhaustion. If the cursed target reaches exhaustion level 6, it doesn't die; it instead becomes a thrall under the quori's control, and all its exhaustion is removed. Only the Wish spell can free the thrall from this control.  ***Swarm of Eyes (Recharge 6).*** The quori creates a swarm of spectral eyes that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.  The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. | | | | | |

Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature has its speed halved by exposure to the potent brew. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  Additionally, the beer shower extinguishes any fires or open flames in its area.  ***Hot Oil Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The keg robot sprays hot oil in a 15-foot cone or in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (1d8 + 3) fire damage and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone.  Any creature affected by the hot oil spray that takes fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute) takes an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage, and the oil burns away.  If the oil that remains in the area of the spray is lit, it burns for 1d4 rounds and deals 3 (1d6) fire damage to any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. | | | | | |

# Kelpie

From Tales From the Yawning Portal, page 238.

| Kelpie | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium plant, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 67 (9d8 + 27)  **Speed:** 10 ft., swim 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  14 (+2) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  7 (-2) | **WIS**  12 (+1) | **CHA**  10 (0) |
| **Skills:** Perception +3, Stealth +4  **Damage Resistances:** fire, bludgeoning, piercing  **Condition Immunities:** blinded, deafened, exhaustion  **Senses:** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 13  **Languages:** Common, Sylvan  **Challenge Rating:** 4 (1,100 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Amphibious.*** The kelpie can breathe air and water.  ***False Appearance.*** While the kelpie remains motionless in its true form, it is indistinguishable from normal seaweed.  ***Seaweed Shape.*** The kelpie can use its action to reshape its body into the form of a humanoid or beast that is Small, Medium, or Large. Its statistics are otherwise unchanged. The disguise is convincing, unless the kelpie is in bright light or the viewer is within 30 feet of it, in which case the seams between the seaweed strands are visible. The kelpie returns to its true form if takes a bonus action to do so or if it dies. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The kelpie makes two slam attacks.  ***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12).  ***Drowning Hypnosis.*** The kelpie chooses one humanoid it can see within 150 feet of it. If the target can see the kelpie, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed while the kelpie maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). The charmed target is incapacitated, and instead of holding its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and immediately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the kelpie, the target must move on its turn toward the kelpie by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks.  Before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the kelpie or drowning, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.  A target that successfully saves is immune to this kelpie's hypnosis for the next 24 hours. | | | | | |

Such creatures are rarely aggressive toward others that aren't normally prey. Evil creatures can't tolerate the holy atmosphere within the same distance, and usually choose to live much farther from the domain of a ki-rin.. * Curses, diseases, and poisons affecting good-aligned creatures are suppressed when those creatures are within 3 miles of the lair. * A ki-rin can cast Control Weather while it is within 3 miles of its lair. The spell's point of origin is always the point outdoors closest to the center of its lair. The ki-rin doesn't need to maintain a clear path to the sky or to concentrate for the change in weather to persist. * Within 3 miles of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the ki-rin or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.   When the ki-rin dies, all these effects disappear immediately, although the invigorating effect on flora and fauna remains for 3 years. | | | | | |

Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding Klauth's lair is warped by Klauth's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. * Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur. * Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

| ***Amphibious.*** The kraken can breathe air and water.  ***Freedom of Movement.*** The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.  ***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.  If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.  ***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.  ***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.  ***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Tentacle Attack or Fling.** The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.  **Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).** The kraken uses Lightning Storm.  **Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the kraken takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:   * A strong current moves through the kraken's lair. Each creature within 60 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from the kraken. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the kraken. * Creatures in the water within 60 feet of the kraken have vulnerability to lightning damage until initiative count 20 on the next round. * The water in the kraken's lair becomes electrically charged. All creatures within 120 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing a kraken's lair is warped by the creature's blasphemous presence, creating the following magical effects:   * The kraken can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the Control Weather spell. * Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals can't leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (-5). * Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the kraken and aggressive toward intruders in the area.   When the kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade immediately. | | | | | |
