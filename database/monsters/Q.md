| ***Axiomatic Mind.*** The quadrone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.  ***Disintegration.*** If the quadrone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.  ***Variant: Rogue Modrons.*** A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. Rogue modrons don't act in accordance with Primus's wishes and directives, breaking laws, disobeying orders, and even engaging in violence. Other modrons hunt down such rogues.  A rogue modron loses the Axiomatic Mind trait and can have any alignment other than lawful neutral. Otherwise, it has the same statistics as a regular modron of its rank. | | | | | |

While the quasit is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the quasit's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the quasit can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond. | | | | | |

Any equipment the quasit wears or carries is invisible with it. | | | | | |
