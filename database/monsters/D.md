# Dao

From Monster Manual, page 143.

| Dao | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large elemental, neutral evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 187 (15d10 + 105)  **Speed:** 30 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  23 (+6) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  24 (+7) | **INT**  12 (+1) | **WIS**  13 (+1) | **CHA**  14 (+2) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +5, Wis +5, Cha +6  **Condition Immunities:** petrified  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 11  **Languages:** Terran  **Challenge Rating:** 11 (7,200 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Earth Glide.*** The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through.  ***Elemental Demise.*** If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.  ***Spellcasting.*** The dao's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *Cantrips (at will):* Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, Stone Shape  *3/day each:* Passwall, Move Earth, Tongues  *1/day each:* Conjure Elemental (Earth Elemental only), Gaseous Form, Invisibility, Phantasmal Killer, Plane Shift, Wall of Stone  ***Variant: Genie Powers.** Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.*   * **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the Disguise Self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the True Polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well. * **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.   To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the Wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.  ***Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.  ***Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone. | | | | | |

| **STR**  20 (+5) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  19 (+4) | **INT**  15 (+2) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  16 (+3) |

Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  ***Variant: Control Gem.*** Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.  Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem.

| ***Negative Energy Cone.*** The death tyrant's central eye emits an invisible, magical 150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.   Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely destroyed. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) piercing damage.  ***Eye Rays.*** The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:   1. **Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the tyrant for 1 hour, or until the tyrant harms the creature. 2. **Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 3. **Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. **Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 5. **Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 6. **Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the tyrant moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the tyrant's next turn or until the tyrant is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container. 7. **Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead. 8. **Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic. 9. **Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it. 10. **Death Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The death tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tyrant regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Eye Ray.** The death tyrant uses one random eye ray. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the death tyrant takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:   * An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the tyrant is filled with spectral eyes and tentacles. To creatures other than the death tyrant, that area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round. * Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Any creature, including one on the Ethereal Plane, that is hostile to the tyrant and starts its turn within 10 feet of a wall must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. * An spectral eye opens in the air at a point within 50 feet of the tyrant. One random eye ray of the tyrant shoots from the eye, which is considered to be an ethereal source, at a target of the tyrant's choice. The eye then closes and disappears.   The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until they have all three have been used, and it can't use the same effect on consecutive rounds. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrants's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched even when they aren't. * When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of its existence finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair, roll a d20 for that creature. On a roll of 10 or lower, the creature is subjected to one random eye ray of the tyrant.   If the tyrant dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |

# Demogorgon

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 144.

| Demogorgon | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 22 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 406 (28d12 + 224)  **Speed:** 50 ft., swim 50 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  29 (+9) | **DEX**  14 (+2) | **CON**  26 (+8) | **INT**  20 (+5) | **WIS**  17 (+3) | **CHA**  25 (+7) |
| **Saving Throws:** Dex +10, Con +16, Wis +11, Cha +15  **Skills:** Insight +11, Perception +19  **Damage Resistances:** cold, fire, lightning  **Damage Immunities:** poison; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  **Condition Immunities:** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned  **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 29  **Languages:** all, telepathy 120 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 26 (90,000 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Demogorgon's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23). Demogorgon can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Magic, Major Image  *3/day each:* Dispel Magic, Fear, Telekinesis  *1/day each:* Feeblemind, Project Image  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Demogorgon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** Demogorgon's weapon attacks are magical.  ***Two Heads.*** Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Demogorgon makes two tentacle attacks.  ***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (3d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.  ***Gaze.*** Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.  If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random:   1. ***Beguiling Gaze.*** The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight. 2. ***Hypnotic Gaze.*** The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn. 3. ***Insanity Gaze.*** The target suffers the effect of the Confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Demogorgon can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Demogorgon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.  **Maddening Gaze.** Demogorgon uses his Gaze action, and must choose either the Beguiling Gaze or the Insanity Gaze effect. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Demogorgon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, hitting him with an attack), there is a 50 percent chance that it is the illusory duplicate that is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears. * Demogorgon casts the Darkness spell four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing Demogorgon's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:   * The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpopulated with lizards, poisonous snakes, and other venomous beasts. * Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become violent and crazed-even creatures that are normally docile. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Demogorgon table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Demogorgon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Demogorgon | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Demogorgon's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Demogorgon table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured.   | d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 01-20 | "Someone is plotting to kill me. I need to strike first to stop them!" | | 21-40 | "There is only one solution to my problems: kill them all!" | | 41-60 | "There is more than one mind inside my head." | | 61-80 | "If you don't agree with me, I'll beat you into submission to get my way." | | 81-00 | "I can't allow anyone to touch anything that belongs to me. They might try to take it away from me!" | | | | | | |

Each foot it clears on a jump costs a foot of movement.  ***Prone deficiency:*** If the Devil's Ride falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until pulled upright.  ***Stunt:*** On it's turn, the driver of the Devil's Ride can expend 10 feet of movement to perform one free vehicle stunt, such as a wheelie or a burn-out. Before the stunt can be performed, the vehicle must move at least 10 feet in a straight line. If the driver succeeds on a DC 10 dexterity check using the bike's dexterity, the stunt is successful. Otherwise, the driver is unable to perform the stunt and cannot perform another stunt until the start of its next turn. If the check fails by 5 or more, the Devil's Ride and all creatures riding it immediately fall prone as the bike wipes out and comes to a dead stop. | | | | | |

# Devourer

From Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 138.

| Devourer | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large fiend, chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 16 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 178 (17d10 + 85)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |

| ***Fiendish Nature.*** The devourer doesn't require air, food (other than souls), drink, or sleep. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The devourer makes two claw attacks and can use either Imprison Soul or Soul Rend.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage.  ***Imprison Soul.*** The devourer chooses a living humanoid with 0 hit points that it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature is teleported inside the devourer's ribcage and imprisoned there. A creature imprisoned in this manner has disadvantage on death saving throws. If it dies while imprisoned, the devourer regains 25 hit points, immediately recharges Soul Rend, and gains an additional action on its next turn. Additionally, at the start of its next turn, the devourer regurgitates the slain creature as a bonus action, and the creature becomes an undead. If the victim had 2 or fewer hit dice, it becomes a zombie. if it had 3 to 5 hit dice, it becomes a ghoul. Otherwise, it becomes a wight. A devourer can imprison only one creature at a time.  ***Soul Rend (Recharge 6).*** The devourer creates a vortex of life-draining energy in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Each humanoid in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Increase the damage by 10 for each living humanoid with 0 hit points in that area. | | | | | |

# Djinni

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/4/48/Djinni.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/240?cb=20221208112632)

From Monster Manual, page 141.

| Djinni | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large elemental, chaotic good* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 161 (14d10 + 84)  **Speed:** 30 ft., fly 90 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  21 (+5) | **DEX**  15 (+2) | **CON**  22 (+6) | **INT**  15 (+2) | **WIS**  16 (+3) | **CHA**  20 (+5) |
| **Saving Throws:** Dex +6, Wis +7, Cha +9  **Damage Immunities:** lightning, thunder  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft.  **Languages:** Auran  **Challenge Rating:** 11 (7,200 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Elemental Demise.*** If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, Thunderwave  *3/day each:* Create Food and Water (can create wine instead of water), Tongues, Wind Walk  *1/day each:* Conjure Elemental (air elemental only), Creation, Gaseous Form, Invisibility, Major Image, Plane Shift  ***Variant: Genie Powers.** Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.*   * **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the Disguise Self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the True Polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well. * **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.   To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the Wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.  ***Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).  ***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.  A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind. | | | | | |

# Dybbuk

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 132.

| Dybbuk | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium fiend (demon), chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14  **Hit Points:** 37 (5d8 + 15)  **Speed:** 0 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover) | | | | | |
| **STR**  6 (-2) | **DEX**  19 (+4) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  16 (+3) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  14 (+2) |

| **Incorporeal Movement.** The dybbuk can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.  **Innate Spellcasting.** The dybbuk's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Dimension Door  *3/day each:* Fear, Phantasmal Force  **Magic Resistance.** The dybbuk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  **Violate Corpse.** The dybbuk can use a bonus action while it is possessing a corpse to make it do something unnatural, such as vomit blood, twist its head all the way around, or cause a quadruped to move as a biped. Any beast or humanoid that sees this behavior must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this ability is immune to Violate Corpse for 24 hours. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Tendril.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is also reduced by 3 (1d6). This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.  ***Possess Corpse (Recharge 6).*** The dybbuk disappears into an intact corpse it can see within 5 feet of it. The corpse must be Large or smaller and be that of a beast or a humanoid. The dybbuk is now effectively the possessed creature. Its type becomes undead, though it now looks alive, and it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the corpse's hit point maximum in life.  While possessing the corpse, the dybbuk retains its hit points, alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, telepathy, and immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's game statistics, gaining access to its knowledge and proficiencies but not its class features, if any.  The possession lasts until the temporary hit points are lost (at which point the body becomes a corpse once more) or the dybbuk ends its possession using a bonus action. When the possession ends, the dybbuk reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse. | | | | | |

# Dyrrn

| ***Alien Mind.*** If a creature tries to read Dyrrn's thoughts or deals psychic damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Dyrrn fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Dyrrn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Regeneration.*** Dyrrn regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. Dyrrn dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.  ***Teleport.*** As a bonus action, Dyrrn can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** Dyrrn makes one Tentacle Whip attack and uses its Corruption once. Dyrrn can replace its Tentacle Whip attack with Extract Brain if it has a creature grappled.  ***Tentacle Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d10 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 23), pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of Dyrrn, and must succeed on a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends. Dyrrn can't use the same tentacle whip on another target until this grapple ends. Dyrrn has two tentacle whips.  ***Corruption.*** Dyrrn targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d6 + 8) necrotic damage and become corrupted for 1 minute.  A corrupted creature's flesh twists in alien ways. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, its speed is reduced by half, and if it tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check or the spell fails and is wasted. The corrupted creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated creature grappled by Dyrrn. *Hit:* 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, Dyrrn kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Dyrrn can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Dyrrn regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Tentacle Whip.** Dyrrn makes one tentacle whip attack.  **Spawn Aberration (Costs 2 Actions).** Dyrrn regurgitates an intellect devourer in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The intellect devourer is under Dyrrn's control and acts immediately after Dyrrn in the initiative order.  **Mind Blast (Costs 3 Actions).** Dyrrn magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or take 30 (5d8 + 8) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| While within the Palace of Sinew, Dyrrn can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Dyrrn can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Dyrrn uses its Corruption action. * A 30-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of Dyrrn sprouts tentacles until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that starts or ends its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A creature can escape the tentacles with a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action. * Each creature of Dyrrn's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) psychic damage. Unless the target has immunity to psychic damage, its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4 each time it fails the saving throw for this lair action. The target dies if its Intelligence score is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| A region containing a passage to Dyrrn's lair is warped in one or more of these ways:   * Plants and animals raised within 2 mile of the passage have twisted, aberrant forms. * Creatures within 1 mile of the passage frequently feel as if something is crawling under their skin. * If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see "Madness of Dyrrn" below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.   If Dyrrn dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |
| Madness of Dyrnn | | | | | |
| If a creature goes mad in Dyrrn's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Dyrrn table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured. Chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide has more information on madness.   | d6 | Flaw (lasts until cured) | | --- | --- | | 1 | There's an illithid parasite living in my brain! | | 2 | I can feel myself evolving into an aberration. | | 3 | Aberrations are the only natural things. | | 4 | A part of me has become a conscious entity. | | 5 | My opponents must bow down to a mind flayer! | | 6 | Dyrrn and the mind flayers simply want to unite all sentient creatures in collective consciousness. And I receive messages from the group mind! | | | | | | |
