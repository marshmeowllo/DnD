It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Witch Bolt  *1/day each:* Bestow Curse, Fear, Thunderwave  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the sea fury fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The sea fury has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. | | | | | |

The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The sea fury can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sea fury regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **As Water.** The sea fury transforms into a wave of foaming seawater, along with whatever it is wearing or carrying, and moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. While in this form, it can't be grappled or restrained. It reverts to its true form at the end of this movement.  **Fearsome Apparition (Costs 2 Actions).** The sea fury conjures an apparition of one of its dead sisters, which appears in an unoccupied space the sea fury can see within 30 feet of it. Enemies of the sea fury that can see the apparition must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it until it vanishes at the end of the sea fury's next turn.  **Conjure Snakes (Costs 3 Actions).** The sea fury disgorges a Swarm of Poisonous Snakes, which occupies the same space as the sea fury, acts on its own initiative count, and attacks as directed by the sea fury.

| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sea fury can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Caverns, tunnels, and pools of water within 120 feet of the sea fury become foggy or murky, to the extent that the area becomes heavily obscured. * The sea fury conjures a 15-foot cube of water that fills an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it, then moves the water in a straight line up to 60 feet, after which the water disperses. Any creature that comes into contact with the rushing wave must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone by it and pushed 15 feet along its course. * The sea fury calls forth the spirit of a dead sailor or sea hag that met its end in the lair. This spirit has the statistics of a specter and lasts until the sea fury uses another lair action. The specter appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the sea fury and obeys the sea fury's commands. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing a sea fury's lair is warped by the sea fury's magic, which creates the following effects:   * Sea water within 5 miles of the lair becomes coarse and choppy, as if whipped by an unseen wind. * Sea grass within 1 mile of the lair is imbued with a foul mockery of life, grasping ineffectually at any creature that passes within 5 feet of it. * Ordinary crabs and octopi within 1 mile of the lair grow in size to become giant crabs and giant octopi, respectively. These creatures serve the sea fury as spies and guards. | | | | | |

# Sea Hag

From Monster Manual, page 179.

| Sea Hag | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium fey, chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 52 (7d8 + 41)  **Speed:** 30 ft., swim 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  16 (+3) | **DEX**  13 (+1) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  12 (+1) | **WIS**  12 (+1) | **CHA**  13 (+1) |
| **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11  **Languages:** Aquan, Common, Giant  **Challenge Rating:** 2 (450 XP) or 4 (1,100) when part of a coven | | | | | |
| ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.  ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.  A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.  ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.  A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.  ***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.  Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.  ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:  *1st level (4 slots):* Identify, Ray of Sickness  *2nd level (3 slots):* Hold Person, Locate Object  *3rd level (3 slots):* Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt  *4th level (3 slots):* Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph  *5th level (2 slots):* Contact Other Plane, Scrying  *6th level (1 slot):* Eyebite  For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.  ***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.  ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised. | | | | | |

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 137.

| Sibriex | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 19 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 150 (12d12 + 72)  **Speed:** 0 ft., fly 20 ft. (hover) | | | | | |
| **STR**  10 (0) | **DEX**  3 (-4) | **CON**  23 (+6) | **INT**  25 (+7) | **WIS**  24 (+7) | **CHA**  25 (+7) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +13, Cha +13  **Skills:** Arcana +13, History +13, Perception +13  **Damage Resistances:** cold, fire, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  **Damage Immunities:** poison  **Condition Immunities:** charmed, frightened, poisoned  **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 23  **Languages:** all, telepathy 120 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 18 (20,000 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Contamination.*** The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet in every direction. Plants that aren't creatures wither in the aura, and the ground in it is difficult terrain for other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this sibriex's Contamination for 24 hours.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The sibriex's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 21). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Charm Person, Command, Dispel Magic, Hold Monster  *3/day:* Feeblemind  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the sibriex fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The sibriex has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The sibriex uses Squirt Bile once and makes three attacks using its chain, bite, or both.  ***Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d12 + 7) piercing damage.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.  ***Squirt Bile.*** The sibriex targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (10d6) acid damage.  ***Warp Creature.*** The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a Wish spell.  ***Variant: Flesh Warping.*** Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.  A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.   | d100 | Effect | | --- | --- | | 01-05 | The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned. | | 06-10 | The target's eyes push out of its head at the end of stalks. | | 11-15 | The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers. | | 16-20 | One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet. | | 21-25 | The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open. | | 26-30 | A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet. | | 31-35 | The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened. | | 36-40 | Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks. | | 41-45 | The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1). | | 46-50 | The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls. | | 51-55 | The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet. | | 56-60 | The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet. | | 61-65 | The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip. | | 66-70 | The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. | | 71-75 | The target swells, tripling its weight. | | 76-80 | The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight. | | 81-85 | The target's head doubles in size. | | 86-90 | The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet. | | 91-95 | The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. | | 96-00 | The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned. | | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The sibriex can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sibriex regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Cast a Spell.** The sibriex casts a spell.  **Spray Bile.** The sibriex uses Squirt Bile.  **Warp (Costs 2 Actions).** The sibriex uses Warp Creature. | | | | | |

| ***Aversion of Fire.*** If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.  ***Berserk.*** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.  The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.  ***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.  ***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.  ***Skaab Characteristic: Armor Plating.*** Increase the skaab's Armor Class to 14 and increase its challenge rating to 6 (2,300 XP).  ***Skaab Characteristic: Six Arms.*** The skaab's multiattack action allows it to make three slam attacks.

(Its challenge rating doesn't change.)  ***Skaab Characteristic: Winged Skaab.*** The skaab has a flying speed of 30 feet.  ***Skaab Characteristics:*** The most basic skaabs are simply flesh golems, as described in the Monster Manual. But the aspiration of every skaberen is to produce a truly unique masterpiece, a goal that might see a stitcher create golems with one of the following special characteristics. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.  ***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. | | | | | |

# Spiked Tomb Guardian

From Tomb of Annihilation, page 154.

| Tomb Guardian | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium construct, neutral* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17  **Hit Points:** 93 (11d8 + 44)  **Speed:** 30 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  19 (+4) | **DEX**  9 (-1) | **CON**  18 (+4) | **INT**  6 (-2) | **WIS**  10 (0) | **CHA**  5 (-3) |

| ***Aversion of Fire.*** If the tomb guardian takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.  ***Berserk.*** Whenever the tomb guardian starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the tomb guardian goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the tomb guardian attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the tomb guardian attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the tomb guardian goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. The tomb guardian's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk tomb guardian, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The tomb guardian must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the tomb guardian ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the tomb guardian might go berserk again.  ***Chained.** This trait applies when two guardians are chained together.* A magical spiked chain that binds a pair of guardians together prevents them from moving more than 15 feet apart. Additionally, as long as the chain is intact, damage dealt to either guardian is divided evenly between them. The spiked chain can be attacked separately and has AC 18, a damage threshold of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the chain breaks, both tomb guardians instantly go berserk.  ***Immutable Form.*** The tomb guardian is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.  ***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the tomb guardian is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The tomb guardian has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Magic Weapons.*** The tomb guardian's weapon attacks are magical. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The tomb guardian makes two spiked gauntlet attacks.  ***Spiked Gauntlet.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d6) piercing damage. | | | | | |

# Spore Servant

From Monster Manual, page 230.

A spore servant is any Large or smaller creature brought back to life by the animating spores of a myconid sovereign. A creature that was never flesh and blood to begin with (such as a construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead) can't be turned into a spore servant.

The following characteristics change or are added to a creature that becomes a spore servant.

* ***Retained Characteristics.*** The servant retains its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities.
* ***Lost Characteristics.*** The servant loses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and special traits. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.
* ***Type.*** The servant's type is plant, and it loses any tags.
* ***Alignment.*** The servant is unaligned.
* ***Speed.*** Reduce all the servant's speeds by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet.
* ***Ability Scores.*** The servant's ability scores change as follows: Int 2 (-4), Wis 6 (-2), Cha 1 (-5).
* ***Senses.*** The servant has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet, and it is blind beyond this radius.
* ***Condition Immunities.*** The servant can't be blinded, charmed, frightened, or paralyzed.
* ***Languages.*** The servant loses all known languages, but it responds to orders given to it by myconids using rapport spores. The servant gives highest priority to orders received from the most powerful myconid.
* ***Attacks.*** If the servant has no other means of dealing damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + the servant's Strength modifier, or, if the servant is Large, 2d4 + its Strength modifier.

See the quaggoth spore servant entry for an example spore servant using a quaggoth as the base creature.

On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours.  Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  ***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. | | | | | |

| ***Shapechanger.*** The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  ***Telepathic Bond.*** The fiend ignores the range restriction on its telepathy when communicating with a creature it has charmed. The two don't even need to be on the same plane of existence. | | | | | |

If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours.  The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.  ***Draining Kiss.*** The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.  ***Etherealness.*** The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. | | | | | |

| ***Immortal Nature.*** Sul Khatesh doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep. She also can't die permanently. Upon her death, she reforms elsewhere in the multiverse and becomes active again at a time set by the DM.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** Sul Khatesh's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 26, +18 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  *At will:* Counterspell, Detect Magic, Detect Thoughts, Dispel Magic, Eyebite, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Shield  *3/day each:* Chain Lightning, Create Undead, Dream, Hold Monster, Mass Suggestion, Scrying  *1/day each:* Foresight, Gate, Power Word Kill, Teleport  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Sul Khatesh fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.  ***Magic Resistance.*** Sul Khatesh has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  ***Master of Magic.*** Sul Khatesh has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. | | | | | |

| ***Multiattack.*** Sul Khatesh makes four attacks with Arcane Blast.  ***Arcane Blast.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +18 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (1d10 + 10) force damage.  ***Magic Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (5d12 + 4) force damage.  ***Arcane Cataclysm (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** Sul Khatesh conjures orbs of magical energy that plummet to the ground at three different points she can see within 1 mile of her. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point must make a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw, taking 71 (11d12) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one arcane burst is affected only once. The area of each arcane burst then acts as an Antimagic Field for 1 hour. Sul Khatesh and spells she casts are unaffected by these fields.  ***Change Shape.*** Sul Khatesh magically polymorphs into a humanoid, beast, or giant that has a challenge rating no higher than her own, or back into her true form. She reverts to her true form if she dies. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (her choice).  In a new form, Sul Khatesh retains her alignment, hit points, hit dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Her statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Sul Khatesh can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Sul Khatesh regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Attack.** Sul Khatesh makes two attacks with her Arcane Blast or one attack with her magic staff.  **Consume Magic (Costs 2 Actions).** Sul Khatesh targets a creature within 120 feet of her who is concentrating on a spell. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or its concentration is broken on the spell, and Sul Khatesh gains 5 temporary hit points per level of that spell.  **Maddening Secrets (Costs 3 Actions).** Sul Khatesh whispers an arcane secret into the mind of a creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or expend one of its spell slots of 3rd level or lower and deal 26 (4d12) force damage to each creature within 30 feet of it. A creature that fails the saving throw but can't expend a spell slot is instead stunned until the end of its next turn. | | | | | |

Any creature that comes into contact with it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the rot grub burrows into the creature's flesh and deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage at the start of each of the host creature's turns. Applying fire to the wound before the end of the host creature's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the host and kills the infesting rot grub. After this time, the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target. Burning a body kills any rot grubs infesting it. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +0 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* The target is infested by 1d4 rot grubs. At the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned.  If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target. | | | | | |
