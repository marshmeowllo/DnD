When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it. | | | | | |

# Aboleth

From Monster Manual, page 13.

| Aboleth | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Large aberration, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 135 (18d10 + 36)  **Speed:** 10 ft., swim 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  21 (+5) | **DEX**  9 (-1) | **CON**  15 (+2) | **INT**  18 (+4) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  18 (+4) |
| **Saving Throws:** Con +6, Int +8, Wis +6  **Skills:** History +12, Perception +10  **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 20  **Languages:** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.  **Challenge Rating:** 10 (5,900 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Amphibious.*** The aboleth can breathe air and water.  ***Mucous Cloud.*** While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.  ***Probing Telepathy.*** If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.  ***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.  ***Enslave (3/Day).*** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.  Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Swipe.** The aboleth makes one tail attack.  **Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:   * The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected. * Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one. * Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain. * Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes. * As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.   If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days. | | | | | |

The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the Control Weather spell. * Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues. * Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.   If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days. | | | | | |

| **STR**  23 (+6) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  21 (+5) | **INT**  18 (+4) | **WIS**  15 (+2) | **CHA**  17 (+3) |

| ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters.*** Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant: A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell's level can be no higher than one third the dragon's challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon's bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon's spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:   * **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. * Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts. * Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.   If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately. | | | | | |

It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).  In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, hit dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action.

When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied. | | | | | |

| The region surrounding a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams.

It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.

The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings.

The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. * A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. * Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the 'thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. * Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. * Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path. * Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.   If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns. | | | | | |

# Adult Oblex

From Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, page 218.

| Adult Oblex | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Medium ooze, lawful evil* | | | | | |
| **Armor Class:** 14  **Hit Points:** 75 (10d8 + 30)  **Speed:** 20 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  8 (-1) | **DEX**  19 (+4) | **CON**  16 (+3) | **INT**  19 (+4) | **WIS**  12 (+1) | **CHA**  15 (+2) |
| **Saving Throws:** Int +7, Cha +5  **Skills:** Deception +5, Perception +4, plus one of the following: Arcana +7, History +7, Nature +7, or Religion +7  **Condition Immunities:** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, prone  **Senses:** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this distance), passive Perception 14  **Languages:** Common plus two more languages  **Challenge Rating:** 5 (1,800 XP) | | | | | |
| ***Amorphous.*** The oblex can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  ***Aversion to Fire.*** If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The oblex's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:  *3/day each:* Charm Person (as a 5th-level spell), Color Spray, Detect Thoughts, Hold Person (as a 3rd-level spell)  ***Ooze Nature.*** The oblex doesn't require sleep.  ***Sulfurous Impersonation.*** As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The oblex makes one pseudopod attack and uses Eat Memories  ***Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) psychic damage.  ***Eat Memories.*** The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the Greater Restoration or Heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends. When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies. | | | | | |

| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. * Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. * Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur. * Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. * The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick.

Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does during the current turn:   | d8 | Effect | | --- | --- | | 1-4 | The creature is stunned until the end of the turn. | | 5-6 | The creature is frightened until the end of the turn and uses its movement to get as far as possible from the nullifier. | | 7-8 | The creature doesn't move, and it uses its action to make one melee attack against a random creature (other than itself) if one is within reach.

| ***Fey Ancestry.*** Aerisi has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep.  ***Howling Defeat.*** When Aerisi drops to 0 hit points, her body disappears in a howling whirlwind that disperses quickly and harmlessly. Anything she is wearing or carrying is left behind.  ***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If Aerisi fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.  ***In the Air Node.*** When danger threatens the Temple of Howling Hatred, Aerisi retreats to the Howling Caves, the air node. Within this node, Aerisi gains one additional use of her Legendary Resistance trait.  ***Spellcasting.*** Aerisi is a 12th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). Aerisi has the following wizard spells prepared:  Cantrips (at will): Gust, Mage Hand, Message, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost, Shocking Grasp  1st level (4 slots): Charm Person, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Thunderwave  2nd level (3 slots): Dust Devil, Gust of Wind, Invisibility  3rd level (3 slots): Fly, Gaseous Form, Lightning Bolt  4th level (3 slots): Ice Storm, Storm Sphere  5th level (2 slots): Cloudkill, Seeming (cast each day)  6th level (1 slot): Chain Lightning | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Windvane.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage, or 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| If Aerisi is in the air node while Yan-C-Bin isn't, Aerisi can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Aerisi uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Aerisi can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action.  If Aerisi casts Invisibility using this lair action, she also draws the power of the air node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (3d8 + 2) hit points. | | | | | |

A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until the amnizu dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. | | | | | |
| Reactions | | | | | |
| ***Instinctive Charm.*** When a creature within 60 feet of the amnizu makes an attack roll against it, and another creature is within the attack's range, the attacker must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including the amnizu or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. If the saving throw is successful, the attacker is immune to the amnizu's Instinctive Charm for 24 hours. | | | | | |

| ***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters.*** Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant: A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell's level can be no higher than one third the dragon's challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon's bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon's spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales acid in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 67 (15d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. * A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. * Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud. * Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes. * Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.   If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days. | | | | | |

| Legendary Actions | | | | | |

The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. * Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage. | | | | | |

| The region surrounding a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair. * Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an Air Elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5). * Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair.

It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).  In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. | | | | | |

Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. * A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed. * Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. * Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.   If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately. | | | | | |

| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round. * One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking. * Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger. * Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.   If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately. | | | | | |

| ***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.  ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  ***Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters.*** Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant: A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell's level can be no higher than one third the dragon's challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon's bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon's spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage.  ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  ***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (22d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. | | | | | |
| Lair Actions | | | | | |
| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. * A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. * Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. | | | | | |
| Regional Effects | | | | | |
| The region surrounding a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:   * Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the 'thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. * Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. * Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path. * Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.   If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns. | | | | | |

| On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:   * Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. * The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants.

The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.   If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days. | | | | | |

| ***Wielder Domination.*** A creature can grab the staff out of the air with a successful grapple check against the staff, and grappling the staff does not reduce the creature's speed. Any creature that successfully grapples the staff must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the staff until the staff is no longer in its grasp. While the creature is charmed, the staff can issue commands to it, which the creature does its best to obey. The creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully resists the staff's control can't be charmed by it for 24 hours. A creature holding the staff that isn't charmed by it can use an action to attempt to break the staff over a knee or against a solid surface, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. Breaking the staff in this manner destroys it. | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Staff of Frost.*** The staff has 10 charges. It can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 12): Cone of Cold (5 charges), Fog Cloud (1 charge), Ice Storm (4 charges), or Wall of Ice (4 charges). It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the staff expends its last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.  ***Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 1 cold damage. | | | | | |

In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | | | | | |

| **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)  **Hit Points:** 75 (10d10 + 20)  **Speed:** 40 ft. | | | | | |
| **STR**  21 (+5) | **DEX**  12 (+1) | **CON**  14 (+2) | **INT**  13 (+1) | **WIS**  14 (+2) | **CHA**  15 (+2) |
| **Saving Throws:** Con +5  **Skills:** Deception +5, Perception +5  **Damage Resistances:** cold; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15  **Languages:** Common, Giant, Sylvan  **Challenge Rating:** 6 (2,300 XP) or 8 (3,900 XP) when part of a coven | | | | | |
| ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.  A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.  ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.  A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.  ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). She can innately cast the following spells:  *3/day each:* Disguise Self (including the form of a Medium humanoid), Fog Cloud  ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:  *1st level (4 slots):* Identify, Ray of Sickness  *2nd level (3 slots):* Hold Person, Locate Object  *3rd level (3 slots):* Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt  *4th level (3 slots):* Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph  *5th level (2 slots):* Contact Other Plane, Scrying  *6th level (1 slot):* Eyebite  For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.  ***Variant: Death Coven.*** For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the following spells:  *1st level (4 slots):* False Life, Inflict Wounds  *2nd level (3 slots):* Gentle Repose, Ray of Enfeeblement  *3rd level (3 slots):* Animate Dead, Revivify, Speak With Dead  *4th level (3 slots):* Blight, Death Ward  *5th level (2 slots):* Contagion, Raise Dead  *6th level (1 slot):* Circle of Death  ***Variant: Nature Coven.*** For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the following spells:  *1st level (4 slots):* Entangle, Speak With Animals  *2nd level (3 slots):* Flaming Sphere, Moonbeam, Spike Growth  *3rd level (3 slots):* Call Lightning, Plant Growth  *4th level (3 slots):* Dominate Beast, Grasping Vine  *5th level (2 slots):* Insect Plague, Tree Stride  *6th level (1 slot):* Wall of Thorns  ***Variant: Prophecy Coven.*** For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the following spells:  *1st level (4 slots):* Bane, Bless  *2nd level (3 slots):* Augury, Detect Thoughts  *3rd level (3 slots):* Clairvoyance, Dispel Magic, Nondetection  *4th level (3 slots):* Arcane Eye, Locate Creature  *5th level (2 slots):* Geas, Legend Lore  *6th level (1 slot):* True Seeing | | | | | |
| Actions | | | | | |
| ***Multiattack.*** The annis makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.  ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) piercing damage.  ***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.  ***Crushing Hug.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (9d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target takes 36 (9d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the hag's turns. The hag can't make attacks while grappling a creature in this way. | | | | | |

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.   ***Change Shape.*** Aurinax magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than his own, or back into his true form. He reverts to his true form if he dies. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Aurinax's choice).  In a new form, Aurinax retains his alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. His statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. | | | | | |
| Legendary Actions | | | | | |
| Aurinax can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Aurinax regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  **Detect.** Aurinax makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.  **Tail Attack.** Aurinax makes a tail attack.  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Aurinax beats his wings. Each creature within 10 feet of Aurinax must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Aurinax can then fly up to half his flying speed. | | | | | |
