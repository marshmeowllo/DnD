![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/9/98/Artificer.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/301?cb=20221129092505)

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons
* **Tools:** Thieves' tools, tinker's tools, one type of artisan's tools of your choice
* **Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence
* **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, and Sleight of Hand

### Equipment[]

* any two simple weapons of your choice
* a light crossbow and 20 bolts
* (a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail
* Thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

### Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency[]

The secrets of creating and operating gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

## Magical Tinkering[]

*1st level artificer feature*

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

* The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
* Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
* The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
* A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

## Spellcasting[]

*1st level artificer feature*

You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way, you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

### Tools Required[]

You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus — specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool — in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

### Cantrips (0-Level spells)[]

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent in tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

## Infuse Item[]

*2nd-level artificer feature*

You've gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

### Infusions Known[]

When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

### Infusing an Item[]

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement.

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a Bag of Holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

## Artificer Specialist[]

*3rd-level artificer feature*

Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 9th, and 15th level.

* Alchemist
* Armorer
* Artillerist
* Battle Smith

## The Right Tool for the Job[]

*3rd-level artificer feature*

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

*4th-level artificer feature*

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Tool Expertise[]

*6th-level artificer feature*

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

## Flash of Genius[]

*7th-level artificer feature*

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Magic Item Adept[]

*10th-level artificer feature*

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

* You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
* If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

## Spell-Storing Item[]

*11th-level artificer feature*

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing one 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

## Magic Item Savant[]

*14th-level artificer feature*

Your skill with magic items deepens:

* You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
* You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

## Magic Item Master[]

*18th-level artificer feature*

You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.

## Soul of Artifice[]

*20th-level artificer feature*

You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

* You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

## Alchemist[]

### Tool Proficiency[]

*3rd-level Alchemist feature*

You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### Alchemist Spells[]

*3rd-level Alchemist feature*

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Healing Word, Ray of Sickness |
| 5th | Flaming Sphere, Melf's Acid Arrow |
| 9th | Gaseous Form, Mass Healing Word |
| 13th | Blight, Death Ward |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Raise Dead |

### Experimental Elixir[]

*3rd-level Alchemist feature*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an *experimental elixir* in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.

#### Experimental Elixir Table[]

| d6 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Healing:** The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier. |
| 2 | **Swiftness:** The drinker's walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour. |
| 3 | **Resilience:** The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes. |
| 4 | **Boldness:** The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute. |
| 5 | **Flight:** The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes. |
| 6 | **Transformation:** The drinker's body is transformed as if by the Alter Self spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes. |

### Alchemical Savant[]

*5th-level Alchemist feature*

You've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

### Restorative Reagents[]

*9th-level Alchemist feature*

You can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

* Whenever a creature drinks an *experimental elixir* you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
* You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Chemical Mastery[]

*15th-level Alchemist feature*

You have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

* You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.
* You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a long rest.

## Armorer[]

### Tools of the Trade[]

*3rd-level Armorer feature*

You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### Armorer Spells[]

*3rd-level Armorer feature*

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Magic Missile, Thunderwave |
| 5th | Mirror Image, Shatter |
| 9th | Hypnotic Pattern, Lightning Bolt |
| 13th | Fire Shield, Greater Invisibility |
| 17th | Passwall, Wall of Force |

### Arcane Armor[]

*3rd-level Armorer feature*

Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:

* If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
* You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
* The armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.
* You can doff or don the armor as an action.

The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.

### Armor Model[]

*3rd-level Armorer feature*

You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

You can change the armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

* ***Guardian.*** You design your armor to be in the frontline of conflict. It has the following features:
  + **Thunder Gauntlets.** Each of the armor's gauntlets count as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.
  + **Defensive Field.** As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
* ***Infiltrator.*** You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:
  + **Lightning Launcher.** A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.
  + **Powered Steps.** Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
  + **Dampening Field.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, as normal.

### Extra Attack[]

*5th-level Armorer feature*

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Armor Modifications[]

*9th-level Armorer feature*

You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.

### Perfected Armor[]

*15th-level Armorer feature*

Your power armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.

* ***Guardian.*** When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

:   You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

* ***Infiltrator.*** Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it by a creature other than you has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

## Artillerist[]

### Tools Proficiency[]

*3rd-level Artillerist feature*

You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### Artillerist Spells[]

*3rd-level Artillerist feature*

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Shield, Thunderwave |
| 5th | Scorching Ray, Shatter |
| 9th | Fireball, Wind Wall |
| 13th | Ice Storm, Wall of Fire |
| 17th | Cone of Cold, Wall of Force |

### Eldritch Cannon[]

*3rd-level Artillerist feature*

You've learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand.

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As a part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.

| Turret | Activation |
| --- | --- |
| Flamethrower | The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. |
| Force Ballista | Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon. |
| Protector | The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). |

### Arcane Firearm[]

*5th-level Artillerist feature*

You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

### Explosive Cannon[]

*9th-level Artillerist feature*

Every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive:

* The cannon's damage rolls all increase by 1d8.
* As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Fortified Position[]

*15th-level Artillerist feature*

You're a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannon:

* You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a Cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.
* You can now summon two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.

## Battle Smith[]

### Tool Proficiency[]

*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*

You gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### Battle Smith Spells[]

*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Heroism, Shield |
| 5th | Branding Smite, Warding Bond |
| 9th | Aura of Vitality, Conjure Barrage |
| 13th | Aura of Purity, Fire Shield |
| 17th | Banishing Smite, Mass Cure Wounds |

### Battle Ready[]

*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*

Your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:

* You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
* When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

### Steel Defender[]

*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*

Your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel defender. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the Mending spell is cast on the defender, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have your smith's tools with you. If you already have a steel defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

### Extra Attack[]

*5th-level Battle Smith feature*

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Arcane Jolt[]

*9th-level Battle Smith feature*

You've learned new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:

* The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
* Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.

### Improved Defender[]

*15th-level Battle Smith feature*

Your Arcane Jolt and steel defender become more powerful:

* The extra damage and the healing of your Arcane Jolt both increase to 4d6.
* Your steel defender gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
* Whenever your steel defender uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.

## Artificer Infusions[]

Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.

Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.

### Arcane Propulsion Armor[]

:   *Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer*
:   *Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)*

The wearer of the armor gains these benefits:

* The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.
* The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detatches then flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.
* The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.
* If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs — hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.

### Armor of Magical Strength[]

:   *Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)*

This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:

* When the wearer makes a Strength check or Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.
* If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.

The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Boots of the Winding Path[]

:   *Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer*
:   *Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)*

While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see. The creature must have occupied that space at some point during the current turn.

### Enhanced Arcane Focus[]

:   *Item: A rod, staff, or wand (requires attunement)*

While holding this item, a creature gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

### Enhanced Defense[]

:   *Item: A suit of armor or a shield*

A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

### Enhanced Weapon[]

:   *Item: A simple or martial weapon*

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

### Helm of Awareness[]

:   *Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer*
:   *Item: A helmet (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helmet, a creature has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the wearer can't be surprised, provided it isn't incapacitated.

### Homunculus Servant[]

:   *Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100gp*

You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.

You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.

The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the Mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.

### Mind Sharpener[]

:   *Item: A suit of armor or robes*

The infused item can send a jolt to the wearer to refocus their mind. This item has 4 charges. When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the wearer can use its reaction to expend 1 charge of the item's charges to succeed instead. The item regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Radiant Weapon[]

:   *Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer*
:   *Item: A simple or martial weapon (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.

The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the wielder can expend 1 charge and cause the attacker to be blinded until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Repeating Shot[]

:   *Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.

If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

### Replicate Magic Item[]

:   *Prerequisite: See below*

Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Magic Items tables below. A table's title tells the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the table. Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls.

In the tables, an item's entry tells you whether the item requires attunement. See the item's description for more information about it, including the type of object required for its making.

The shield has 4 charges. While holding it, the wielder can use a reaction immediately after being hit by a melee attack to expend 1 of the shield's charges and push the attacker up to 15 feet away. The shield regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 24)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a barbarian.
Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use one, both, or none of them.

#### Primal Knowledge[]

*3rd-level barbarian feature*

When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.

#### Instinctive Pounce[]

*7th-level barbarian feature*

As part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d12 per barbarian level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per barbarian level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution
* **Skills:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival

### Equipment[]

* (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon
* (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
* An explorer's pack and four javelins

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 2d4 x 10 gp.

## Rage[]

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on all Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

## Unarmored Defense[]

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

## Reckless Attack[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

## Danger Sense[]

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

## Primal Path[]

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

* Path of the Ancestral Guardian (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 9)
* Path of the Battlerager (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 121)
* Path of the Beast (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 24)
* Path of the Berserker (Player's Handbook, page 49)
* Path of the Storm Herald (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 9)
* Path of the Totem Warrior (Player's Handbook, page 50; Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 121)
* Path of Wild Magic (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 25)
* Path of the Zealot (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 11)

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Fast Movement[]

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

## Feral Instinct[]

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

## Brutal Critical[]

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

## Relentless Rage[]

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

## Persistent Rage[]

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

## Indomitable Might[]

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

## Primal Champion[]

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

## Path of the Ancestral Guardian[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 9)

### Ancestral Protectors[]

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

### Spirit Shield[]

Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.

### Consult the Spirits[]

At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of Clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Vengeful Ancestors[]

At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.

## Path of the Battlerager[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 121)

### Restriction: Dwarves Only[]

Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.

### Battlerager Armor[]

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use Spiked Armor as a weapon.

While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.

### Reckless Abandon[]

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish when your rage ends.

### Battlerager Charge[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while raging.

### Spiked Retribution[]

Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor.

## Path of the Beast[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 24)

### Form of the Beast[]

*3rd-level Path of the Beast feature*

When you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal.

You choose the weapons's form each time you rage.

* **Bite:** Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half of your hit points when you hit.
* **Claws:** Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it's empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.
* **Tail:** You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

### Bestial Soul[]

*6th-level Path of the Beast feature*

The feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish your next short or long rest:

* You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
* You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
* When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check's total. You can make this special check only once per turn.

### Infectious Fury[]

*10th-level Path of the Beast feature*

When you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the spirit within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice):

* The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
* The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Call the Hunt[]

*14th-level Path of the Beast feature*

The beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can each use the following benefit once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to the damage equal to the number rolled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Path of the Berserker[]

(Player's Handbook, page 49)

### Frenzy[]

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

### Mindless Rage[]

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Retaliation[]

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

## Path of the Storm Herald[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 10)

### Storm Aura[]

Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.

If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

* **Desert:** When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.
* **Sea:** When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.
* **Tundra:** When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

### Storm Soul[]

At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

* **Desert:** You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don't suffer the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.
* **Sea:** You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.
* **Tundra:** You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don't suffer the effects of extreme cold. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.

### Shielding Storm[]

At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

### Raging Storm[]

At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

* **Desert:** Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.
* **Sea:** When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.
* **Tundra:** Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.

## Path of the Totem Warrior[]

(Player's Handbook, page 50; Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 121)

### Spirit Seeker[]

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the Beast Sense and Speak With Animals spells, but only as rituals.

### Totem Spirit[]

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

* **Bear:** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
* **Eagle:** While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.
* **Wolf:** While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.
* **Elk (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide):** While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.
* **Tiger (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide):** While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.

### Aspect of the Beast[]

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.

* **Bear:** You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
* **Eagle:** You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.
* **Wolf:** You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.
* **Elk (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide):** Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.
* **Tiger (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide):** You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.

### Spirit Walker[]

At 10th level, you can cast the Commune With Nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.

### Totemic Attunement[]

At 14th level you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

* **Bear:** While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.
* **Eagle:** While raging you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.
* **Wolf:** While you're raging you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.
* **Elk (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide):** While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.
* **Tiger (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide):** While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.

## Path of Wild Magic[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 25)

### Lingering Magic[]

*3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature*

As an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn what school of magic it belongs to.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Wild Surge[]

*3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature*

The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced.

If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

| d8 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Shadowy tendrils lash around you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. You also gain 1d12 temporary hit points. |
| 2 | You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |
| 3 | An intangible spirit, which looks like a flumph or a pixie, appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, the spirit explodes, and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again, summoning another spirit, on each of your turns as a bonus action. |
| 4 | Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your rage ends, the weapon's damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn. |
| 5 | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before your rage ends, that creature takes 1d6 force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution. |
| 6 | Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by multicolored, protective lights: you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus. |
| 7 | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you: until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies. |
| 8 | A bolt of light shoots from your chest. Another creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |

### Bolstering Magic[]

*6th-level Path of Wild Magic feature*

You can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:

* For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll.
* Roll a d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature's choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, the creature can't receive it again until after a long rest.

You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Unstable Backlash[]

*10th-level Path of Wild Magic feature*

When you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out: immediately after you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use your reaction to roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.

### Controlled Surge[]

*14th-level Path of Wild Magic feature*

Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.

## Path of the Zealot[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 11)

### Divine Fury[]

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

### Warrior of the Gods[]

At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as Raise Dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.

### Fanatical Focus[]

Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while you're raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

### Zealous Presence[]

At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Rage Beyond Death[]

Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

The material in this article is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination.

They aren't officially part of the game and aren't permitted in D&D Adventurers League events. **Ask your Dungeon Master before using any material on this page.**

# Giant Options[]

(Unearthed Arcana 2022: Giant Options)

## Path of the Giant[]

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Giant draw strength from the primal forces that are the Giants and their elemental ilk. Their rages surge with elemental power and cause these barbarians to grow in size, transforming them into avatars of primordial might. During their rage, a barbarian may take after a legendary storm giant, hair turning white and eyes crackling with lightning. Others adopt the monstrous features of apocalyptic titans, rending the world around them so that it may be made anew.

### Giant Power[]

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write Giant or one other language of your choice if you already know Giant. Additionally, you learn either the Druidcraft or Thaumaturgy cantrip (your choice). Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Giant's Havoc[]

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your rages pull strength from the primal might of giants, transforming you into a hulking force of destruction. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

**Crushing Hurl.** When you make a successful ranged attack with a thrown weapon using Strength, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the attack’s damage roll.

**Giant Stature.** Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn’t enough room for you to become Large, your size doesn’t change.

### Elemental Cleaver[]

At 6th level, your bond with the elemental might of giants and their ilk grows, and you learn to infuse weapons with primordial energy.

When you enter your rage, you can infuse one weapon of your choice that you are holding with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, thunder, or lightning. While you wield the infused weapon during your rage, the weapon’s damage type changes to the chosen type, it deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type when it hits, and it gains the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you throw the weapon, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target. The infused weapon’s benefits are suppressed while a creature other than you wields it.

While raging and holding the infused weapon, you can use a bonus action to change the infused weapon’s current damage type to a different one from the above damage types.

### Mighty Impel[]

At 10th level, your connection to giant strength now allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. As a bonus action while raging, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.

If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn’t on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing prone.

### Demiurgic Colossus[]

Starting at 14th level, the primordial power of your rage intensifies. When you rage, your reach now increases by 10 feet, your size can
increase to Huge, and you can now use your Mighty Impel to move creatures that are Large or smaller. In addition, the extra damage dealt by your Elemental Cleaver feature increases to 2d6.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Survival Instincts[]

*2nd-level barbarian feature (replaces Danger Sense)*

You become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Survival.
Your proficiency is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.

## Instinctive Pounce[]

*5th-level barbarian feature (replaces Fast Movement)*

When a creature ends its turn within 15 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed to a space closer to the creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

*1st-level bard feature (enhances Spellcasting)*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the bard spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

# Kits of Old[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old)

## College of Satire[]

Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.

While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.

For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.

Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.

Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you join the College of Satire at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools. You also gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand and one additional skill of your choice. If you are already proficient with thieves' tools or in Sleight of Hand, choose another skill proficiency for each proficiency you already have.

### Tumbling Fool[]

At 3rd level, you master a variety of acrobatic techniques that allow you to evade danger. As a bonus action, you can tumble. When you tumble, you gain the following benefits for the rest of your turn:

* You gain the benefits of taking the Dash and Disengage actions.
* You gain a climbing speed equal to your current speed.
* You take half damage from falling.

### Fool's Insight[]

At 6th level, your ability to gather stories and lore gains a supernatural edge. You can cast Detect Thoughts up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest.

If a creature resists your attempt to probe deeper and succeeds at its saving throw against your Detect Thoughts, it immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe. It might loudly pass gas, unleash a thunderous burp, trip and fall, or be compelled to tell a tasteless joke.

### Fool's Luck[]

Jesters seem to have a knack for pulling themselves out of tight situations, transforming what looks like sure failure into an embarrassing but effective success.

At 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration after you fail an ability check, fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one.

If using this ability grants you a success on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. The DM can then apply that result as a penalty to an attack or check you make, and you cannot use this ability again until you suffer this drawback. When the DM invokes this penalty, describe an embarrassing gaffe or mistake you make as part of the affected die roll.

# Subclasses, Part 4[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Subclasses, Part 4)

## College of Spirits[]

Stories of the past are powerful; they hold lessons of history, philosophy, and magic. Bards of the College of Spirits seek the stories of those from beyond the material plane. Using gaming sets, they reach out to hear their stories, but the bards have no control over what story they find.

### Guiding Whispers[]

*3rd-level College of Spirits*

You can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.

### Spiritual Focus[]

*3rd- and 6th-level College of Spirits feature*

Your practice of contacting spirits can employ special tools. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, a crystal ball, a talking board, a tarokka deck, or a skull.

At 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

### Tales from Beyond[]

*3rd-level College of Spirits feature*

You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirits' Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale told. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale's effect or you finish a short or long rest.

You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale's effect. Once you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again until you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirits' Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.

If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.

#### Spirits' Tales[]

| 1 | **Beast.** You recite the tale of a clever animal. For 1 minute, the target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and advantage on attack rolls against a creature if another enemy is within 5 feet of it, and that enemy isn't incapacitated. |
| 2 | **Warrior.** You recount the story of a renowned duelist. Make a melee spell attack against the target as an attacking spectral warrior briefly appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target before vanishing. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. |
| 3 | **Friends.** You recite the tale of friends who found each other in the afterlife. The target and another creature of its choice it can see within 5 feet of it regains hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. |
| 4 | **Runaway.** You tell the tale of an adventurer that could escape any confinement. The target can immediately use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the target teleports, it can choose a number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to immediately use the same reaction. |
| 5 | **Avenger.** You recount the tale of an avenging knight. For 1 minute, whenever a creature the target can see within 30 feet of it is damaged by a creature, the target can use its reaction to deal force damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to the attacker. |
| 6 | **Hero.** You speak the tale of an epic hero. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your bard level. While it has these temporary hit points, the target's walking speed increases by 10 feet. |
| 7 | **Fey.** You recount the tale of a mischievous fey. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you until the end of its next turn. The charmed target must use its action to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no other creature. |
| 8 | **Dark Spirit.** You speak a dreadful tale of a slayer in the dark. The target becomes invisible until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If it hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, that creature takes necrotic damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and is frightened of the target until the end of its next turn. |
| 9 | **Giant.** You speak of the deeds of a mighty giant. Each creature of the target's choice it can see within 30 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw, taking force damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save and is knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. |
| 10 | **Dragon.** You breathe a poem of a wrathful dragon. The target magically spews fire from their mouth in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 11 | **Celestial.** You speak of the exalted deeds of a celestial. The target regains hit points equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your bard level, and you end one disease or a condition from the following list affecting the target: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. |
| 12 | **Unknown.** You utter an incomprehensible fable from a being beyond the stars. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take psychic damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die, and the target is unable to speak any language for 1 minute. |

### Spirit Session[]

*6th-level College of Spirits feature*

You can channel spirits to gain insights into magic. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.

The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of divination or necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know.

Once you perform the ritual, you can't do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.

### Mystical Connection[]

*14th-level College of Spirits feature*

Your connection to spirits has become semi-permanent. Whenever you use your Tales from Beyond feature, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die. You still use your Bardic Inspiration die for the tale's effect, without expending it.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 27)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a bard. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Additional Bard Spells[]

*1st-level bard feature*

The spells in the following list expand the bard's spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Save | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | Color Spray | Illusion | 1 action | V, S, M |  |  |  | PHB 222 |
| 1st | Command | Enchantment | 1 action | V |  | Wisdom |  | PHB 223 |

| 2nd | Enlarge/Reduce | Transmutation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution | Yes | PHB 237 |
| 2nd | Mirror Image | Illusion | 1 action | V, S |  |  |  | PHB 260 |

| 4th | Phantasmal Killer | Illusion | 1 action | V, S |  | Wisdom | Yes | PHB 265 |
| 5th | Rary's Telepathic Bond | Divination | 1 action | V, S, M |  |  | Yes | PHB 270 |
| 6th | Heroes' Feast | Conjuration | 10 minutes | V, S, M | 1000gp |  |  | PHB 250 |
| 7th | Dream of the Blue Veil | Conjuration | 10 minutes | V, S, M |  |  |  | TCE 106 |
| 7th | Prismatic Spray | Evocation | 1 action | V, S |  | Dexterity |  | PHB 267 |
| 8th | Antipathy/Sympathy | Enchantment | 1 hour | V, S, M |  | Wisdom |  | PHB 214 |
| 9th | Prismatic Wall | Abjuration | 1 action | V, S |  | Constitution, Dexterity |  | PHB 267 |

#### Magical Inspiration[]

*2nd-level bard feature*

If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.

#### Bardic Versatility[]

*4th-level bard feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change in focus as you use your skills and magic:

* Replace one of the skills you chose for the Expertise feature with one of your other skill proficiencies that isn't benefiting from Expertise.
* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the bard spell list.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per bard level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per bard level after 1st

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/6/67/DND_Art6.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/264?cb=20221129071857)

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords
* **Tools:** Three musical instruments of your choice
* **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose any three

### Equipment[]

* (a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon
* (a) a Diplomat's Pack or (b) an Entertainer's Pack
* (a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument
* Leather armor and a dagger

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Spellcasting[]

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.

### Cantrips[]

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.

### Spell Slots[]

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher[]

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

## Bardic Inspiration[]

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

## Jack of All Trades[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Song of Rest[]

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

## Bard College[]

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

* College of Creation (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 28)
* College of Eloquence (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 29; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 28)
* College of Glamour (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 14)
* College of Lore (Player's Handbook, page 54)
* College of Spirits (Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, page 28)
* College of Swords (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 15)
* College of Valor (Player's Handbook, page 55)
* College of Whispers (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 16)

## Expertise[]

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Font of Inspiration[]

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

## Countercharm[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

## Magical Secrets[]

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.

## Superior Inspiration[]

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.

## College of Creation[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 28)

### Mote of Potential[]

*3rd-level College of Creation feature*

Whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that you choose.

When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:

**Ability Check.** When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.

**Attack Roll.** Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.

**Saving Throw.** Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

### Performance of Creation[]

*3rd-level College of Creation feature*

As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can create, see the Armor, Weapons, Adventuring Gear, Tools, and Mounts and Vehicles tables.

Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes.

The size of the item you can create with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).

### Animating Performance[]

*6th-level College of Creation feature*

As an action, you can animate one Large or smaller nonmagical item within 30 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB). The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.

In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turns is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration. Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

### Creative Crescendo[]

*14th-level College of Creation feature*

When you use your Performance of Creation feature, you can create more than one item at once. The number of items equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of two items). If you create an item that would exceed that number, you choose which of the previously created items disappears. Only one of these items can be of the maximum size you can create; the rest must be Small or Tiny.

You are no longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.

## College of Eloquence[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 29; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 28)

### Silver Tongue[]

*3rd-level College of Eloquence feature*

You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Unsettling Words[]

*3rd-level College of Eloquence feature*

You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

### Unfailing Inspiration[]

*6th-level College of Eloquence feature*

Your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.

### Universal Speech[]

*6th-level College of Eloquence feature*

You have gained the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.

### Infectious Inspiration[]

*14th-level College of Eloquence feature*

When you successfully inspire someone, the power of your eloquence can now spread to someone else. When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, and the roll succeeds, you can use your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## College of Glamour[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 14)

### Mantle of Inspiration[]

When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures you can see and that can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level.

### Enthralling Performance[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.

If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mantle of Majesty[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast Command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast Command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a spell slot.

Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Unbreakable Majesty[]

At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.

In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## College of Lore[]

(Player's Handbook, page 54)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

### Cutting Words[]

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

### Additional Magical Secrets[]

At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.

### Peerless Skill[]

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

## College of Spirits[]

(Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, page 28)

### Guiding Whispers[]

*3rd-level College of Spirits feature*

You can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.

### Spiritual Focus[]

*3rd-level College of Spirits feature*

You employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

### Tales from Beyond[]

*3rd-level College of Spirits feature*

You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale's effect or you finish a short or long rest.

You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale's effect. Once you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again until you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.

If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.

#### Spirit Tales[]

| Bardic Insp. Die | Tale Told Through You |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Tale of the Clever Animal.** For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma check, the target can roll an extra die immediately after rolling the d20 and add the extra die's number to the check. The extra die is the same type as your Bardic Inspiration die. |
| 2 | **Tale of the Renowed Duelist.** You make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. |
| 3 | **Tale of the Beloved Friends.** The target and another creature of its choice it can see within 5 feet of it gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. |
| 4 | **Tale of the Runaway.** The target can immediately use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the target teleports, it can choose a number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) to immediately use the same reaction. |
| 5 | **Tale of the Avenger.** For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes force damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die. |
| 6 | **Tale of the Traveler.** The target gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your bard level. While it has these temporary hit points, the target's walking speed increases by 10 feet and it gains a +1 bonus to its AC. |
| 7 | **Tale of the Beguiler.** The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die, and the target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. |
| 8 | **Tale of the Phantom.** The target becomes invisible until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If the target hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, the creature it hits takes necrotic damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and is frightened of the target until the end of the frightened creature's next turn. |
| 9 | **Tale of the Brute.** Each creature of the target's choice it can see within 30 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes thunder damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and is knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. |
| 10 | **Tale of the Dragon.** The target spews fire from their mouth in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to four rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 11 | **Tale of the Angel.** The target regains hit points equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier, and you end one condition from the following list affecting the target: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. |
| 12 | **Tale of the Mind-Bender.** You evoke an incomprehensible fable from an otherworldly being. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take psychic damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and be stunned until the end of its next turn. |

### Spirit Session[]

*6th-level College of Spirits feature*

Spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.

The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of divination or necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know.

Once you perform the ritual, you can't do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.

### Mystical Connection[]

*14th-level College of Spirits feature*

You now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.

## College of Swords[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 15)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and the scimitar.

If you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

### Fighting Style[]

At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again.

* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Blade Flourish[]

At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed.

Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.

* **Defensive Flourish:** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.
* **Mobile Flourish:** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.
* **Slashing Flourish:** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

### Extra Attack[]

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Master's Flourish[]

Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.

## College of Valor[]

(Player's Handbook, page 55)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

### Combat Inspiration[]

Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

### Extra Attack[]

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Battle Magic[]

At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## College of Whispers[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 16)

### Psychic Blades[]

When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.

The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.

### Words of Terror[]

At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.

If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mantle of Whispers[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.

You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.

While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.

Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.

Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.

### Shadow Lore[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature's deepest fears.

As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.

On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.

The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.

When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Spell Versatility[]

*1st-level bard feature (enhances Spellcasting)*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the bard spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

# Mages of Strixhaven[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven])

## Using These Subclasses[]

Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass's entry.

### Choosing the Subclass[]

When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard's Bardic College, a wizard's Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character's class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.

How the subclass manifests in your character's story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer's innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron's usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.

### At Higher Levels[]

Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character's class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as "Level 6+," your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you're a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.

When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History's Whims feature, but not both.

## Mage of Lorehold[]

Mages of Lorehold are particularly concerned with the forces that underlie and drive history. Drawing inspiration from the scholars and adventurers of old, they manifest the arcane power of the past through ethereal dioramas and fantastical battle prowess. Lorehold mages are often found with a long-dead spirit summoned at their side — for who better to learn ancient history from than one who has experienced it first-hand?

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Lorehold subclass, you gain two features: Lorehold Spells and Ancient Companion.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a bard, the College of Lorehold counts as your college; if you're a warlock, the magic of the college serves as your patron; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Lorehold Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

You learn the cantrip Sacred Flame and the 1st-level spell Comprehend Languages. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lorehold Spells table.

Each of these spells counts as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a wizard, you can add these spells to your spellbook upon learning them, without expending any gold, and prepare them as normal.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Knock, Locate Object |
| 5th | Speak With Dead, Spirit Guardians |
| 7th | Arcane Eye, Stone Shape |
| 9th | Destructive Wave, Legend Lore |

### Ancient Companion[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

You learn to call on the spirits of the ancient dead and house them temporarily in the remnants of old statues, so they may remain longer on this plane to bolster your studies and aid you in battle.

Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a Medium, freestanding statue within 10 feet of you to serve as your ancient companion. See this creature's game statistics in the Ancient Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you bond with your ancient companion, choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines certain traits in its stat block. The statue determines the spirit's appearance.

The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.

The companion perishes when it drops to 0 hit points, when you bond with a new ancient companion at the end of a short or long rest, or when you die. When the companion perishes, the spirit within returns to its plane of origin, and the statue becomes an inert object.

### Lessons of the Past[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

Through your studies, you learn how to better listen and take to heart the teachings of history. When you bond with your ancient companion, you gain the following additional benefits depending on the type of spirit you chose:

**Healer.** Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level in this class, and you gain the same number of hit points. When you regain hit points from a spell, you regain an additional 1d8 hit points.

**Sage.** You have advantage on ability checks using the Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion skills. Additionally, once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can deal an additional 1d8 force damage to that creature.

**Warrior.** If you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as part of that action. If that weapon attack hits, the target takes an additional 1d8 radiant damage.

When you bond with a new ancient companion of a different type, you immediately lose the benefits of your previous companion and gain the benefits from the new companion's type.

### War Echoes[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

By pulling from the magic of the past, you can cause your opponent's old wounds to resonate anew. Once per turn, when a creature you can see hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target becomes vulnerable to one of the damage types dealt by the attack. This vulnerability lasts until the end of the target's next turn and affects the damage dealt by the triggering attack.

You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### History's Whims[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

Through steeping yourself in the chaotic whims of history, you learn how to briefly channel the wild nature of time itself. As a bonus action, you can enter a state of chronal chaos. When you enter this state, and at the start of each of your subsequent turns while in this state, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

**Luck.** You receive brief flashes of the future, steeling yourself against oncoming assaults. Whenever you make a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, you can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Resistance.** You rewind time, knitting together injuries as they occur. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

**Swiftness.** Time stutters, slowing others but hurtling you forward. Your movement speed increases by 15 feet, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks.

The benefit lasts until the start of your next turn. You cannot choose the same benefit two rounds in a row.

The state lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to use it again.

## Mage of Silverquill[]

Mages of Silverquill hone the power of words. They channel the magic of light and shadow through words, whether spoken aloud, written, or signed through gestures. The words of a mage of Silverquill bring salvation to their allies and despair to their enemies.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Silverquill subclass, you gain two features: Eloquent Apprentice and Silvery Barbs.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a bard, the College of Silverquill counts as your college, if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron, and if you're a wizard, the college counts as your tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Eloquent Apprentice[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You learn one cantrip of your choice, either Sacred Flame or Vicious Mockery. It doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know, and it is added to your class spell list if it isn't there already.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in your choice of two of the following skills: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, or Insight.

### Silvery Barbs[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You can invoke words laced with magic to demoralize your foes and turn their misfortune into a boon to bolster your allies. Immediately after a creature you can see within 60 feet of you succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to demoralize the creature. Unless the creature is immune to being charmed, it rerolls the d20 and must use the lower roll. If the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw then fails, you can choose a different creature you can see within 60 feet of you (you can choose yourself). That creature is empowered, and can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute and use the higher result. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this feature at a time.

Once a creature fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of a reroll forced by this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.

### Inky Shroud[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You learn the Darkness spell, and it is added to your class spell list if it isn't there already. If you are a wizard, you add it to your spellbook, if it's not there already.

You can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, and you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell in this way, you can see normally through the darkness created, and when a creature you can see starts its turn in the darkness, you can deal 2d10 psychic damage to that creature.

You can also cast the spell normally, without the additional effects, by using spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

### Infusion of Eloquence[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can invoke additional words of power to change the spell's damage type to your choice of psychic or radiant. Any creature damaged by the spell takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus and has its emotions swayed with despair or adoration, based on the damage type dealt:

**Psychic.** The creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

**Radiant.** The creature is charmed by you until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Word of Power[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You can invoke a word of power that is the pinnacle of your magical study. You gain the following options:

**Deadly Despair.** When the target of your Silvery Barbs fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of the reroll, you can invoke a word of despair to give the target vulnerability to one damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn.

**Selfless Invocation.** When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can invoke a word of power using your reaction to grant the creature resistance to that damage, and you take an amount of psychic damage equal to the damage that creature takes.

# Kits of Old[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old])

## College of Satire[]

Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.

While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.

For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.

Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.

Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you join the College of Satire at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools. You also gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand and one additional skill of your choice. If you are already proficient with thieves' tools or in Sleight of Hand, choose another skill proficiency for each proficiency you already have.

### Tumbling Fool[]

At 3rd level, you master a variety of acrobatic techniques that allow you to evade danger. As a bonus action, you can tumble. When you tumble, you gain the following benefits for the rest of your turn:

* You gain the benefits of taking the Dash and Disengage actions.
* You gain a climbing speed equal to your current speed.
* You take half damage from falling.

### Fool's Insight[]

At 6th level, your ability to gather stories and lore gains a supernatural edge. You can cast Detect Thoughts up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest.

If a creature resists your attempt to probe deeper and succeeds at its saving throw against your Detect Thoughts, it immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe. It might loudly pass gas, unleash a thunderous burp, trip and fall, or be compelled to tell a tasteless joke.

### Fool's Luck[]

Jesters seem to have a knack for pulling themselves out of tight situations, transforming what looks like sure failure into an embarrassing but effective success.

At 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration after you fail an ability check, fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one.

If using this ability grants you a success on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. The DM can then apply that result as a penalty to an attack or check you make, and you cannot use this ability again until you suffer this drawback. When the DM invokes this penalty, describe an embarrassing gaffe or mistake you make as part of the affected die roll.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 30)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a cleric. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

#### Additional Cleric Spells[]

*1st-level cleric feature*

The spells in the following list expand the cleric spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Save | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd | Aura of Vitality | Evocation | 1 action | V |  |  | Yes | PHB 216 |
| 3rd | Spirit Shroud | Necromancy | 1 bonus action | V, S |  |  | Yes | TCE 108 |
| 4th | Aura of Life | Abjuration | 1 action | V |  |  | Yes | PHB 216 |
| 4th | Aura of Purity | Abjuration | 1 action | V |  |  | Yes | PHB 216 |
| 5th | Summon Celestial | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 500gp |  | Yes | TCE 110 |
| 6th | Sunbeam | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution | Yes | PHB 279 |
| 8th | Sunburst | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution |  | PHB 279 |
| 9th | Power Word Heal | Evocation | 1 action | V, S |  |  |  | PHB 266 |

#### Harness Divine Power[]

*2nd-level cleric feature*

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on your level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Cantrip Versatility[]

*4th-level cleric feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.

#### Blessed Strikes[]

*8th-level cleric feature, which replaces the Divine Strike or Potent Spellcasting feature*

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature.

Once you deal this damage you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per cleric level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per cleric level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

### Equipment[]

* (a) a mace, or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)
* (a) scale mail, or (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)
* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts, or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) priest's pack, or (b) an explorer's pack
* A shield and a holy symbol

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Spellcasting[]

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

### Cantrips[]

You know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 4th cantrip at 4th level and a 5th at 10th level.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

## Divine Domain[]

Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

* Ambition Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 27)
* Arcana Domain (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 125)
* Death Domain (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 96)
* Forge Domain (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 18)
* Grave Domain (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 19)
* Knowledge Domain (Player's Handbook, page 59)
* Life Domain (Player's Handbook, page 60)
* Light Domain (Player's Handbook, page 60)
* Nature Domain (Player's Handbook, page 61)
* Order Domain (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 31; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 25)
* Peace Domain (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 33)
* Solidarity Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 24)
* Strength Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 25)
* Tempest Domain (Player's Handbook, page 62)
* Trickery Domain (Player's Handbook, page 62)
* Twilight Domain (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 34)
* War Domain (Player's Handbook, page 63)
* Zeal Domain (Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 28)

### Domain Spells[]

Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Channel Divinity[]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Turn Undead[]

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Destroy Undead[]

Starting at 5th level, when an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed. The CR of undead increases as you gain levels.

| Cleric level | Destroys undead of CR... |
| --- | --- |
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |

## Divine Intervention[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Ambition Domain[]

(Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 27)

### Ambition Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Bane, Disguise Self |
| 3rd | Mirror Image, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5th | Bestow Curse, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Death Ward, Dimension Door |
| 9th | Dominate Person, Modify Memory |

### Warding Flare[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

### Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows[]

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Improved Duplicity[]

At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.

## Arcana Domain[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 125)

### Arcana Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Detect Magic, Magic Missile |
| 3rd | Magic Weapon, Nystul's Magic Aura |
| 5th | Dispel Magic, Magic Circle |
| 7th | Arcane Eye, Leomund's Secret Chest |
| 9th | Planar Binding, Teleportation Circle |

### Arcane Initiate[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

### Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, then the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the Banishment spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin, and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown below.

| Cleric Level | Banishes Creature of CR... |
| --- | --- |
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |

### Spell Breaker[]

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Arcane Mastery[]

At 17th level, you choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.

## Death Domain[]

Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, "Equipment," in the Player's Handbook for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

### Eyes of the Grave[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature's life force for termination.

As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.

### Sentinel at Death's Door[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death's progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Keeper of Souls[]

Starting at 17th level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living.

At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.

If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the Suggestion spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Visions of the Past[]

Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

* **Object Reading:** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.
* **Area Reading:** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

You can see through the deepest gloom. You have darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

As an action, you can magically share the darkvision of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). The shared darkvision lasts for 1 hour. Once you share it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to share it again.

### Vigilant Blessing[]

*1st-level Twilight Domain feature*

The night has taught you to be vigilant. As an action, you give one creature you touch (including possibly yourself) advantage on the next initiative roll the creature makes. This benefit ends immediately after the roll or if you use this feature again.

### Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary[]

*2nd-level Twilight Domain feature*

You can use your Channel Divinity to refresh your allies with soothing twilight.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:

* You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your cleric level.
* You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.

### Steps of Night[]

*6th-level Twilight Domain feature*

You can draw on the mystical power of night to rise into the air. As a bonus action when you are in dim light or darkness, you can magically give yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Divine Strike[]

*8th-level Twilight Domain feature*

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Twilight Shroud[]

*17th-level Twilight Domain feature*

The twilight that you summon offers a protective embrace: you and your allies have half cover while in the sphere created by your Twilight Sanctuary.

### Channel Divinity: Guided Strike[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing[]

At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Avatar of Battle[]

At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

### Channel Divinity: Consuming Fervor[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to channel your zeal into unchecked ferocity.

When you roll fire or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

### Resounding Strike[]

At 6th level, when you deal thunder damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Blaze of Glory[]

Starting at 17th level, you can delay death for an instant to perform a final heroic act.

When you are reduced to 0 hit points by an attacker you can see, even if you would be killed outright, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker and make one melee weapon attack against it, as long as the movement brings it within your reach. You make this attack with advantage. If the attack hits, the creature takes an extra 5d10 fire damage and an extra 5d10 damage of the weapon's type. You then fall unconscious and begin making death saving throws as normal, or you die if the damage you took would have killed you outright.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Modern Magic[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic])

## City Domain[]

The City domain is concerned with the citizenry, commerce, traffic, and even architecture of modern civilization. In the eyes of a cleric of the city, the center of modern life is a sense and spirit of community, and the gravest enemies of the city are those who seek to harm the common weal of its citizens.

### City Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Comprehend Languages, Remote Access |
| 3rd | Find Vehicle, Heat Metal |
| 5th | Lightning Bolt, Protection From Ballistics |
| 7th | Locate Creature, Synchronicity |
| 9th | Commune With City, Shutdown |

### Bonus Cantrip[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the On/Off cantrip in addition to your chosen cantrips.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

Also starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with sidearms and proficiency with vehicles (land).

### Heart of the City[]

From 1st level, you are able to tap into the spirit of community found in the city. While you are within any city, you can gain advantage on a single Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check, and you are considered proficient in the appropriate skill. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Spirits of the City[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call on the city for aid. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any city utility within 30 feet of you either works perfectly or shuts down entirely for 1 minute (your choice).

Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone or restrained (your choice) by hazards such as entangling wires, high-pressure water erupting from fire hydrants, pavement collapsing to unseen potholes, and so on. A restrained creature can escape by making a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.

This effect is entirely local and affects only utilities within 30 feet of you. Determination of what utilities are available within range and how the physical effects of those utilities manifest are left to the DM.

### Block Watch[]

Starting at 6th level, your awareness while in the city extends preternaturally. While in an urban environment, you are considered proficient in the Insight and Perception skills, and you add double your proficiency bonus to Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with psychic energy borrowed from the citizens of your city. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra psychic damage increases to 2d8.

### Express Transit[]

At 17th level, you can use mass transit routes to transport instantaneously to other points in the city. Starting from a bus stop, train station, subway stop, or other suitable mass transit site within the city, you can teleport to any other similar transit stop within the city, as if you had cast a teleport spell whose destination is a permanent Teleportation Circle you know. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.

# Wonders of the Multiverse[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Wonders of the Multiverse])

## Fate Domain[]

Gods of fate perceive the future and how the choices mortals make drive them toward their destinies. Some deities consider the future preordained, while others understand the multiverse as a place of infinite possibility. Clerics who draw power from the forces of fate sometimes receive visions directly from their deity and receive fleeting omens of the future. They share impossible knowledge with their allies and prophesize their enemies' doom.

### Fate Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Dissonant Whispers, Heroism |
| 3rd | See Invisibility, Warding Bond |
| 5th | Beacon of Hope, Clairvoyance |
| 7th | Death Ward, Divination |
| 9th | Commune, Geas |

### Omens and Portents[]

At 1st level, you can perceive signs of the future in everyday objects and events, such as flights of birds or ripples made in water by a thrown stone. You can cast the Augury spell without expending a spell slot and, when you cast the spell in this way, the spell has no verbal, somatic, or material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

In addition, until you finish a long rest, when you cast a divination spell that includes a chance the DM gives you no answer or a random reading — such as Augury, Commune, or Divination — reduce that chance by 25 percent.

### Ties That Bind[]

At 1st level, you can temporarily tie your fate to others. As an action, you can touch one object or creature and magically tie a strand of fate from yourself to it for 1 hour or until you use this feature again. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to resist this effect. While the target is bound to you and on the same plane of existence as you, you can sense the direction to the target's location, and you know the direction of its movement if it is in motion.

In addition, once per turn when you cast a spell using a spell slot to deal damage or restore hit points to the target, roll a d6, and the target receives extra damage or healing, respectively, equal to the number rolled.

You can use this feature's action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Strands of Fate[]

At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to see and manipulate the strands of fate that weave around other individuals. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for up to 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever another creature you can see makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can use a reaction to give the roll advantage or disadvantage (your choice).

### Insightful Striking[]

At 6th level, as a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Your magic grants you a brief vision of the target's defenses. Until the end of your next turn, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:

* The next time you make an attack roll against the target, roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.
* The next time the target must make a saving throw against a spell you cast, the target must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the saving throw.

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Potent Spellcasting[]

At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Visions of the Future[]

At 17th level, your knowledge of the future allows you to guide an individual to achieve their greatest possible success. You can cast the Foresight spell once without expending a spell slot; when you cast the spell in this way, the spell's duration is 1 minute for that casting. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Divine Domains[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Divine Domains])

## Protection Domain[]

The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods' faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind. Deities who grant this domain include Helm, Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Paladine, Dol Dorn, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Yondalla, Athena, and Odin.

### Protection Domain Spells[]

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Compelled Duel, Protection From Evil and Good |
| 3rd | Aid, Protection From Poison |
| 5th | Protection From Energy, Slow |
| 7th | Guardian of Faith, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere |
| 9th | Antilife Shell, Wall of Force |

### Bonus Proficiency[]

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Shield of the Faithful[]

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to hinder attacks intended for others. When a creature attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. To do so, you must be able to see both the attacker and the target. You interpose an arm, a shield, or some other part of yourself to try to throw the attack off target.

### Channel Divinity: Radiant Defense[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cloak your allies in radiant armor.

As an action, you channel blessed energy into an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you. The first time that ally is hit by an attack within the next minute, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level.

### Blessed Healer[]

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others can heal you as well. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and it restores hit points to any creature other than you this turn, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

### Divine Strike[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Indomitable Defense[]

At 17th level, you gain resistance to two damage types of your choice, choosing from bludgeoning, necrotic, piercing, radiant, and slashing. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can change the damage types you chose.

As an action, you can temporarily give up this resistance and transfer it to one creature you touch. The creature keeps the resistance until the end of your next short or long rest or until you transfer it back to yourself as a bonus action.

    - 1.1.2 Speech Beyond the Grave
    - 1.1.3 Watcher at the Threshold
    - 1.1.4 Paths of the Dead

# Druid Circles and Wild Shape[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Druid Circles and Wild Shape)

## Circle of Twilight[]

The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

### Harvest's Scythe[]

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a spell, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic damage. If you kill one or more hostile creatures with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Speech Beyond the Grave[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to reach beyond death's veil in search of knowledge. Using this feature, you can cast Speak With Dead without material components, and you understand what the target of this casting says. It can understand your questions, even if you don't share a language or it is not intelligent enough to speak.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Watcher at the Threshold[]

At 10th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. In addition, while you aren't incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you has advantage on death saving throws.

### Paths of the Dead[]

At 14th level, your mastery of death allows you to tread the paths used by ghosts and other spirits. Using this feature, you can cast Etherealness. Once the spell ends, you can't cast it with this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 35)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a druid. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Additional Druid Spells[]

*1st-level druid feature*

The spells in the following list expand the druid spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

#### Wild Companion[]

*2nd-level druid feature*

You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form; as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the Find Familiar spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

#### Cantrip Versatility[]

*4th-level druid feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

## Basic Features[]

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/9/9d/Druid.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20221129095716)

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per druid level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids don't use armor/shields made of metal)
* **Weapons:** Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears
* **Tools:** Herbalism kit
* **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
* **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival

### Equipment[]

* (a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
* Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 2d4 x 10 gp.

## Druidic[]

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

## Spellcasting[]

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

### Cantrips[]

You know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

## Wild Shape[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

| Level | Max CR | Limitations | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | 1 | None | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

## Druid Circle[]

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

* Circle of Dreams (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 22)
* Circle of the Land (Player's Handbook, page 68)
* Circle of the Moon (Player's Handbook, page 69)
* Circle of the Shepherd (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 23)
* Circle of Spores (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 36; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 26)
* Circle of Stars (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 38)
* Circle of Wildfire (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 39)

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Timeless Body[]

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

## Beast Spells[]

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.

## Archdruid[]

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

## Circle of Dreams[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 22)

### Balm of the Summer Court[]

At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow[]

At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

### Hidden Paths[]

Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Walker in Dreams[]

At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.

When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: Dream (with you as the messenger), Scrying, or Teleportation Circle.

This use of Teleportation Circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of the Land[]

(Player's Handbook, page 68)

### Bonus Cantrip[]

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn't count against the number of druid cantrips you know.

### Natural Recovery[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

### Circle Spells[]

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Land's Stride[]

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

### Nature's Ward[]

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

### Nature's Sanctuary[]

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

## Circle of the Moon[]

(Player's Handbook, page 69)

### Combat Wild Shape[]

You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

### Circle Forms[]

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1.

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

### Primal Strike[]

Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Elemental Wild Shape[]

At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.

### Thousand Forms[]

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the Alter Self spell at will.

## Circle of the Shepherd[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 23)

### Speech of the Woods[]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.

You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

### Spirit Totem[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

* **Bear Spirit:** The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.
* **Hawk Spirit:** The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.
* **Unicorn Spirit:** The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.

### Mighty Summoner[]

Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:

* The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.
* The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Guardian Spirit[]

Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.

### Faithful Summons[]

Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of Conjure Animals as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of Spores[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 36; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 96)

### Circle Spells[]

*2nd-level Circle of Spores feature*

Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the Chill Touch cantrip.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Blindness/Deafness, Gentle Repose |
| 5th | Animate Dead, Gaseous Form |
| 7th | Blight, Confusion |
| 9th | Cloudkill, Contagion |

### Halo of Spores[]

*2nd-level Circle of Spores feature*

You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

### Symbiotic Entity[]

*2nd-level Circle of Spores feature*

You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

* When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
* Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

### Fungal Infestation[]

*6th-level Circle of Spores feature*

Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Spreading Spores[]

*10th-level Circle of Spores feature*

You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.
While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.

### Fungal Body[]

*14th-level Circle of Spores feature*

The fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.

## Circle of Stars[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 38)

### Star Map[]

*2nd-level Circle of Stars feature*

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

| d6 | Map Form |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A scroll covered with depictions of constellations |
| 2 | A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it |
| 3 | A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks |
| 4 | A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover |
| 5 | A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light |
| 6 | Glass disks that depict constellations |

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

* You know the Guidance cantrip.
* You have the Guiding Bolt spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
* You can cast Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.

### Starry Form[]

*2nd-level Circle of Stars feature*

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in a starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:

**Archer.** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**Chalice.** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**Dragon.** A constellation of a wise, ancient dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

### Cosmic Omen[]

*6th-level Circle of the Stars feature*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Twinkling Constellations[]

*10th-level Circle of Stars feature*

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

### Full of Stars[]

*14th-level Circle of the Stars feature*

While your Starry Form feature is active, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Circle of Wildfire[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 39)

### Circle Spells[]

*2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

You have formed a mystical bond with a wildfire spirit, a primal being of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you access to certain spells as shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 2nd | Burning Hands, Cure Wounds |
| 3rd | Flaming Sphere, Scorching Ray |

### Summon Wildfire[]

*2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

### Enhanced Bond[]

*6th-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.

### Cauterizing Flames[]

*10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

You gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal the creature or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Blazing Revival[]

*14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall unconscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your hit points and immediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Giant Options[]

(Unearthed Arcana 2022: Giant Options])

## Circle of the Primeval[]

The Circle of the Primeval teaches that, though the land may change over time, it never truly forgets. By tapping into the timeworn memory of the earth, these druids summon and bond with the spirit of a primeval behemoth—a hulking creature that once ruled the ancient world alongside the giants. The most well-known primeval behemoths are the dinosaurs, but spirits bonded with members of the Circle of the Primeval have also taken the form of ancient predecessors to today’s common beasts and other fantastical titanic creatures.

Working alongside their companion spirit, most druids of the Circle of the Primeval spend their lives delving into long-forgotten places and preserving the remnants of bygone eras. As a druid’s power grows, so does their companion, the beast starting near equal in size to its druid partner before increasing in stature until it too towers over the land.

### Keeper of Old[]

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, your connection to the mighty primeval behemoths allows you new insight into the ancient world.

You gain proficiency in the History skill. When you make an Intelligence (History) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Primeval Companion[]

Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can call upon the primeval creature whose spirit is bound to you. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your primeval companion, rather than assuming a beast form. The companion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you.

The primeval companion is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Primeval Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You can determine the cosmetic appearance of the companion; for example, your companion may evoke ancient predators like raptors or saber-toothed tigers, or it might be more inclined for defense, appearing as an armored ankylosaurus or a wooly rhino. These choices have no effect on the companion’s game statistics.

In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The companion remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points or until you die, at which point the companion vanishes. If you use this feature to summon the companion again and you already have a companion present, the first companion immediately vanishes. Anything the companion was wearing or carrying is left behind when the companion vanishes.

### Prehistoric Conduit[]

At 6th level, You learn how to channel your magic through your primeval companion. When you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your primeval companion.

In addition, if the primeval companion is affected by a spell you cast that allows creatures to make a savingthrow against its effects, the primeval companion has advantage on its saving throw. If the primeval companion would normally take half damage on a successful save against this spell, the companion instead takes no damage on a successful save and half damage with no additional effects on a failed save.

### Titanic Bond[]

At 10th level, The primeval companion grows to Large size, and when you summon it, you can grant it either a climbing speed or a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.

In turn, the primeval companion lends you some of its terrifying might. Once per turn while your primeval companion is summoned, when you hit a creature with an attack or deal damage to a creature you can see with a spell you cast, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC; on a failure, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Scourge of the Ancients[]

At 14th level, you have learned to fully harness the titanic legacy of your companion. As part of the bonus action you use to command your companion, you can expend a spell slot of any level to heighten your primeval companion’s might, granting it the following benefits:

**Hulking Behemoth.** The companion becomes Huge and gains temporary hit points equal to 10 times the level of the spell slot expended. If there isn’t enough room for the companion to become Huge, it attains the maximum possible size in the space available.

**Mauler.** On a hit, the companion’s Strike deals additional damage equal to 1d8 plus the level of the spell slot expended.

**Titanic Stride.** The companion’s walking speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot expended.

These benefits last for 1 hour, until the companion vanishes, or until you expend a spell slot for this feature again.

# Mages of Strixhaven[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven])

## Using These Subclasses[]

Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass's entry.

### Choosing the Subclass[]

When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard's Bardic College, a wizard's Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character's class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.

How the subclass manifests in your character's story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer's innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron's usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.

### At Higher Levels[]

Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character's class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as "Level 6+," your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you're a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.

When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History's Whims feature, but not both.

## Mage of Prismari[]

Mages of Prismari use surges of elemental energy to express who they are and how they see the world. To them, magic and motion are one and the same; both are exhibitions of raw creativity through which masterpieces are made. In their pursuit of the arts, some Prismari mages focus on perfecting the fine details of their technique, while others prefer to unleash their wild creative visions in dazzling spectacles of elemental power.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Prismari subclass, you gain two features: Creative Skills and Kinetic Artistry.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Prismari counts as your circle; if you're a sorcerer, the magic of the college is the origin of your sorcery; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Creative Skills[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, or Performance.

### Kinetic Artistry[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You can Dash as a bonus action. When you take this bonus action, choose one of the following additional effects:

**Boreal Sweep.** Icy water swirls around you. Until the end of your turn, you can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless solid ground. Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.

**Scorching Whirl.** Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier.

**Thunderlight Jaunt.** You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

You can use a bonus action in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Favored Medium[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You have honed your forms of elemental expression to best suit your ideas. Choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. You gain resistance to that damage type.

Additionally, when you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals the chosen damage type, you emit a spectacular aura of artistry, which extends 5 feet from you in every direction (but not through total cover) and lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, each creature of your choice has resistance to your chosen damage type while within the aura, as you shape your favored elemental medium around them.

You can change your choice of damage type whenever you finish a long rest.

### Focused Expression[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Honing your talents, you skillfully infuse your motions with even more potent expressions of elemental might. Once per turn when you deal damage to at least one target, you gain an additional effect determined by the damage type chosen for your Favored Medium feature:

**Cold.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 cold damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, as ice mires it. A target can be affected by the ice only once per round.

**Fire.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 fire damage. Fortifying flames then dance around one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature gains 1d6 temporary hit points.

**Lightning.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 lightning damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn, as residual lightning shocks its form.

### Impeccable Physicality[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Your relentless dedication and training have instilled an outstanding sense of precision and grace in your art. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if you do not already have it. Additionally, when you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can treat a d20 roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.

## Mage of Witherbloom[]

Mages of Witherbloom draw their magic from the energy that endlessly flows from life to death, and back again. They see the duality of thriving life and inevitable death in all things, tapping and manipulating the transition of energy between these states. Some Witherbloom adherents focus on vital energies to nurture life and empower others, while others embrace the drain of vitality into decay to sap and strike down their foes.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Witherbloom subclass, you gain two features: Witherbloom Spells and Essence Tap.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Witherbloom counts as your circle, and if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Witherbloom Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You learn the cantrip Spare the Dying and the 1st-level spells Cure Wounds and Inflict Wounds. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Witherbloom Spells table.

Each of these spells count as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a druid, you always have the spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Lesser Restoration, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5th | Revivify, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Blight, Greater Restoration |
| 9th | Antilife Shell, Mass Cure Wounds |

### Essence Tap[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

As a bonus action, you can draw on a reservoir of life essence to empower yourself for 1 minute, or until you use this feature again. For the duration, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

**Overgrowth.** When you choose this benefit, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while the benefit lasts, you can expend and roll one Hit Die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Withering Strike.** When you deal damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic, and you ignore resistance to necrotic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Witherbloom Brew[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You gain proficiency with herbalism kits if you don't already have it.

When you finish a long rest, you can use an herbalism kit and a pot or cauldron to create magical brews. You create a number of brews equal to your proficiency bonus. Each brew requires its own flask. A brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. For each brew, choose one of the following effects:

**Fortifying.** When you create this brew, choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or radiant. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient gains resistance to the chosen damage type for 1 hour.

**Quickening.** A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 2d6 hit points, and one disease or condition from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user's choice): charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.

**Toxifying.** As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The next time the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature within 1 hour, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute.

### Witherbloom Adept[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

Your connection to the flow of life force deepens. Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage or restore hit points using a spell, one target of the spell takes additional damage or regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Withering Vortex[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

When you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals necrotic damage to any number of creatures that aren't Undead or Constructs, choose one of the creatures that took damage. You drain an amount of life energy equal to half the damage dealt to the chosen creature. One creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the life energy drained.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Druid Circles and Wild Shape[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Druid Circles and Wild Shape])

## Circle of Twilight[]

The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

### Harvest's Scythe[]

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a spell, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic damage. If you kill one or more hostile creatures with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Speech Beyond the Grave[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to reach beyond death's veil in search of knowledge. Using this feature, you can cast Speak With Dead without material components, and you understand what the target of this casting says. It can understand your questions, even if you don't share a language or it is not intelligent enough to speak.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Watcher at the Threshold[]

At 10th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. In addition, while you aren't incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you has advantage on death saving throws.

### Paths of the Dead[]

At 14th level, your mastery of death allows you to tread the paths used by ghosts and other spirits. Using this feature, you can cast Etherealness. Once the spell ends, you can't cast it with this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 41)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a fighter. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Fighting Style Options[]

*1st-level fighter feature*

When you choose a fighting style, the following styles are added to your list of options.

**Blind Fighting.** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

**Interception.** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

**Superior Technique.** You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

**Thrown Weapon Fighting.** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

**Unarmed Fighting.** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

## Arcane Archer[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 28)

### Arcane Archer Lore[]

At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature — typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the Prestidigitation or the Druidcraft cantrip.

### Arcane Shot[]

At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below).

Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

### Magic Arrow[]

At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.

### Curving Shot[]

At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

### Ever-Ready Shot[]

Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.

### Arcane Shot Options[]

The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC is calculated as follows:

Arcane Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

* **Banishing Arrow:** You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target's speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

:   After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.

* **Beguiling Arrow:** Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

:   The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

* **Bursting Arrow:** You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.

:   The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

* **Enfeebling Arrow:** You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

:   The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

* **Grasping Arrow:** When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

:   The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

* **Piercing Arrow:** You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

:   The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

* **Seeking Arrow:** Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.

:   The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

* **Shadow Arrow:** You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

:   The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

## Battle Master[]

(Player's Handbook, page 73)

### Combat Superiority[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

* **Maneuvers:** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are listed under "Maneuvers" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

:   You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

* **Superiority Dice:** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

:   You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

* **Saving Throws:** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

:   Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

### Student of War[]

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tool of your choice.

### Know Your Enemy[]

At 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

* Strength score
* Dexterity score
* Constitution score
* Armor Class
* Current hit points
* Total class levels (if any)
* Fighter class levels (if any)

### Improved Combat Superiority[]

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

### Relentless[]

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

### Maneuvers[]

* **Ambush (TCE 42):** When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.
* **Bait and Switch (TCE 42):** When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated.

* **Brace (TCE 42):** When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you're wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature using that weapon.

That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

* **Distracting Strike:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

* **Feinting Attack:** You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target.

Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach.

### Battle Master Builds[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 46)

A Martial Archetype option in the Player's Handbook, the Battle Master showcases just how versatile a fighter can be. The suite of maneuvers you choose, when combined with a fighting style and feats, allows you to create a broad range of fighters, each with its own flavor and play style. Below are recommendations for how you might build a Battle Master to reflect various types of warriors.

Each of these builds contains suggested fighting styles, maneuvers, and feats. Those suggestions are from the Player's Handbook, except for the ones followed by an asterisk, which indicates an option introduced in this book.

#### Archer[]

* **Fighting Style:** Archery
* **Maneuvers:** Disarming Attack, Distracting Strike, Precision Attack
* **Feats:** Piercer,\* Sharpshooter

You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar, trusting to a well placed arrow, javelin, or sling bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that "those who live by the sword die by the bow."

#### Bodyguard[]

* **Fighting Style:** Interception\*, Protection
* **Maneuvers:** Bait and Switch\*, Disarming Attack, Goading Attack, Grappling Strike\*
* **Feats:** Alert, Observant, Sentinel, Tough

Love, money, or some other obligation motivates you to place your own body between harm and the one you're sworn to protect. You have honed the ability to sniff out potential threats and see your charge through dangerous situations.

#### Brawler[]

* **Fighting Style:** Blind Fighting\*, Two-Weapon Fighting, Unarmed Fighting\*
* **Maneuvers:** Ambush,\* Disarming Attack, Feinting Attack, Pushing Attack, Trip Attack
* **Feats:** Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Resilient, Shield Master, Tavern Brawler, Tough

When bottles start breaking and chairs start flying, you're in your element. You love a good scrap and you've likely seen your share of them. You may or may not have formal training, and while others might call you a dirty fighter, you're still alive.

#### Duelist[]

* **Fighting Style:** Dueling, Two-Weapon Fighting
* **Maneuvers:** Evasive Footwork, Feinting Attack, Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack, Riposte
* **Feats:** Defensive Duelist, Dual Wielder, Martial Adept, Observant, Savage Attacker

You regard the duel as a proud tradition—a test of skill and wits that bring honor to those who can detest an enemy while respecting the art. Your search for improvement is a consuming passion, and you draw on the expertise of the masters who've come before you as you work to perfect your form.

#### Gladiator[]

* **Fighting Style:** Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting
* **Maneuvers:** Goading Attack, Menacing Attack, Sweeping Attack, Trip Attack
* **Feats:** Athlete, Charger, Dual Wielder, Durable, Grappler, Martial Adept, Savage Attacker, Tough

You've fought to entertain crowds, whether for sport or as punishment. Along the way, you learned to use all manner of weapons to battle all kinds of adversaries. You're practical yet theatrical, and you know how to employ fear as an effective tool in a fight.

#### Hoplite[]

* **Fighting Style:** Defense, Thrown Weapon Fighting\*
* **Maneuvers:** Brace\*, Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack
* **Feats:** Athlete, Grappler, Piercer,\* Polearm Master, Sentinel, Shield Master

With spear and shield you follow in the footsteps of the heroes of ages past. You rely on discipline and athleticism to overcome improbable odds. Whether fighting in ranks alongside your comrades or squaring off as a lone warrior, you're equal to the task.

#### Lancer[]

* **Fighting Style:** Dueling
* **Maneuvers:** Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Precision Attack, Pushing Attack
* **Feats:** Heavy Armor Master, Mounted Combatant, Savage Attacker

When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You ride out to greet your enemy with the point of your weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and only the heaviest blows can deter you.

#### Outrider[]

* **Fighting Style:** Archer
* **Maneuvers:** Ambush\*, Distracting Strike, Goading Attack, Precision Attack, Quick Toss\*
* **Feats:** Alert, Crossbow Expert, Mounted Combat, Observant, Sharpshooter

You find freedom in the saddle and a companion in your mount. A headlong charge into combat is a blunt instrument for oafs. You prefer mobility and range, opting for find advantageous positions that allow you to deal with foes at full gallop while evading the most dangerous threats.

#### Pugilist[]

* **Fighting Style:** Unarmed Fighting\*
* **Maneuvers:** Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork, Grappling Strike\*, Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Riposte, Trip Attack
* **Feats:** Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Savage Attacker, Tavern Brawler

Where others rely on steel, you've got your fists. Whether through training or experience, you've developed a superior technique that can help you overcome an enemy in an up-close fight.

#### Shock Trooper[]

* **Fighting Style:** Great Weapon Fighting
* **Maneuvers:** Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Sweeping Attack
* **Feats:** Charger, Great Weapon Master, Heavy Armor Master

Subtlety is not your style. You've trained to get straight into the fighting, busting through enemy lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly. Those who ignore you in combat do so at their peril.

#### Skirmisher[]

* **Fighting Style:** Archery, Thrown Weapon Fighting\*
* **Maneuvers:** Ambush\*, Bait and Switch\*, Distracting Strike, Quick Toss\*
* **Feats:** Alert, Dual Wielder, Mobile, Skulker

You thrive amid the chaos of battle. You use your mobility and versatility in combat to soften your adversaries and disrupt their formations. An enemy's plan rarely survives contact with you.

#### Strategist[]

* **Fighting Style:** Defense
* **Maneuvers:** Commander's Strike, Commanding Presence\*, Maneuvering Attack, Rally, Tactical Assessment\*
* **Feats:** Inspiring Leader, Keen Mind, Linguist

To you, battles unfold like a game of chess. You understand that strength and speed are important to a fight, but it takes intellect and experience to know how to best apply them. That's where you come in.

## Cavalier[]

(Xanathar's Guide To Everything, page 30)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

### Born to the Saddle[]

Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.

Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

### Unwavering Mark[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Warding Maneuver[]

At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Hold the Line[]

At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Ferocious Charger[]

Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### Vigilant Defender[]

Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

## Champion[]

(Player's Handbook, page 72)

### Improved Critical[]

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

### Remarkable Athlete[]

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

### Additional Fighting Style[]

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

### Superior Critical[]

Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

### Survivor[]

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Echo Knight[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, pages 183-184)

### Manifest Echo[]

At 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you're incapacitated.

Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

You can use the echo in the following ways:

* As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo's space. You make this choice for each attack.
* When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space.

### Unleash Incarnation[]

At 3rd level, you can heighten your echo's fury. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo's position.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Echo Avatar[]

At 7th level, you can temporarily transfer your consciousness to your echo. As an action, you can see through your echo's eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are deafened and blinded. You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.

### Shadow Martyr[]

At 10th level, you can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Reclaim Potential[]

At 15th level, you've learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don't already have temporary hit points.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Legion of One[]

At 18th level, you can use a bonus action to create two echoes with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can coexist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo's position can be done from the other's instead.

In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.

## Eldritch Knight[]

(Player's Handbook, page 74)

### Spellcasting[]

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

| Fighter Level | Cantrips | Spells | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd | 2 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — |
| 4th | 2 | 4 | 3 | — | — | — |
| 7th | 2 | 5 | 4 | 2 | — | — |
| 8th | 2 | 6 | 4 | 2 | — | — |
| 10th | 3 | 7 | 4 | 3 | — | — |
| 11th | 3 | 8 | 4 | 3 | — | — |
| 13th | 3 | 9 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — |
| 14th | 3 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — |
| 16th | 3 | 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | — |
| 19th | 3 | 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 20th | 3 | 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

#### Cantrips[]

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots[]

The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot.

#### Spells Known[]

You know three 1st level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

#### Spellcasting Ability[]

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + proficiency bonus + Intelligence mod

**Spell attack mod** = proficiency bonus + Intelligence mod

### Weapon Bond[]

At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

### War Magic[]

Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Eldritch Strike[]

At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

### Arcane Charge[]

At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

### Improved War Magic[]

Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Psi Warrior[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 42)

### Psionic Power[]

*3rd-level Psi Warrior feature*

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.

***Protective Field.*** When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic Energy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.

***Psionic Strike.*** You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it and dealing force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

***Telekinetic Movement.*** You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

### Telekinetic Adept[]

*7th-level Psi Warrior feature*

You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.

***Psi-Powered Leap.*** As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

***Telekinetic Thrust.*** When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the save fails, you can knock
the target prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.

### Guarded Mind[]

*10th-level Psi Warrior feature*

The psionic energy flowing through you has bolstered your mind. You have resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn charmed or frightened, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those conditions.

### Bulwark of Force[]

*15th-level Psi Warrior feature*

You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated.

Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

### Telekinetic Master[]

*18th-level Psi Warrior feature*

Your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by few. You can cast the Telekinesis spell, requiring no components, and your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you concentrate on the spell, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a bonus action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to cast it again.

## Purple Dragon Knight[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 128)

### Restriction: Knighthood[]

Purple Dragon Knights are tied to a specific order of Cormyrean knighthood.

Banneret serves as the generic name for this archetype if you use it in other campaign settings or to model warlords other than the Purple Dragon Knights.

### Rallying Cry[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.

When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.

### Royal Envoy[]

A Purple Dragon Knight serves as an envoy of the Cormyrean crown. Knights of high standing are expected to conduct themselves with grace.

At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from this feature.

### Inspiring Surge[]

Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you.

Starting at 18th level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one.

### Bulwark[]

Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

## Rune Knight[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 44)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

*3rd-level Rune Knight feature*

You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.

### Rune Carver[]

*3rd-level Rune Knight feature*

| Fighter Level | Runes Known |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | 2 |
| 7th | 3 |
| 10th | 4 |
| 15th | 5 |

You can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.

The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

***Cloud Rune.*** This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Fire Rune.*** This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Frost Rune.*** This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Stone Rune.*** This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).*** This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Storm Rune (7th level or Higher).*** Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Giant's Might[]

*3rd-level Rune Knight feature*

You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:

* If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Runic Shield[]

*7th-level Rune Knight feature*

You learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Great Stature[]

*10th-level Rune Knight feature*

The magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll.

Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.

### Master of Runes[]

*15th-level Rune Knight feature*

You can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Runic Juggernaut[]

*18th-level Rune Knight feature*

You learn to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.

## Samurai[]

(Xanathar's Guide To Everything, page 31)

### Bonus Proficiency[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

### Fighting Spirit[]

Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.

You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Elegant Courtier[]

Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Tireless Spirit[]

Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.

### Rapid Strike[]

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.

### Strength Before Death[]

Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Waterborne Adventures[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures])

## Fighting Style[]

### Mariner[]

As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

# Light, Dark, Underdark![]

(Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!])

## Fighting Style[]

### Close Quarters Shooter[]

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

### Tunnel Fighter[]

You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Maneuver Options[]

*1st-level feature (enhances Maneuvers)*

If you have access to maneuvers, the following maneuvers are added to the list of options available to you. Maneuvers are available to Battle Masters and to characters who have the Superior Technique fighting style or the Martial Adept feat.

### Restraining Strike[]

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action to grapple the target. Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check. The target is also restrained while grappled in this way.

### Silver Tongue[]

When you make a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

### Snipe[]

As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged weapon attack. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

### Studious Eye[]

When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

# Three Subclasses[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Three Subclasses])

## Brute[]

Brutes are simple warriors who rely on mighty attacks and their own durability to overcome their enemies. Some brutes combine this physical might with tactical cunning. Others just hit things until those things stop hitting back.

### Brute Force[]

Starting at 3rd level, you're able to strike with your weapons with especially brutal force. Whenever you hit with a weapon that you're proficient with and deal damage, the weapon's damage increases by an amount based on your level in this class, as shown on the Brute Bonus Damage table.

| Fighter Level | Damage Increase |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | 1d4 |
| 10th | 1d6 |
| 16th | 1d8 |
| 20th | 1d10 |

### Brutish Durability[]

Beginning at 7th level, your toughness allows you to shrug off assaults that would devastate others.

Whenever you make a saving throw, roll 1d6 and add the die to your saving throw total. If applying this bonus to a death saving throw increases the total to 20 or higher, you gain the benefits of rolling a 20 on the d20.

### Additional Fighting Style[]

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style feature.

### Devastating Critical[]

Starting at 15th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon's damage roll equal to your level in this class.

### Survivor[]

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns in combat, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points or if you have more than half of your hit points left.

# Gothic Heroes[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Heroes])

## Monster Hunter[]

As an archetypal Monster Hunter, you are an expert at defeating supernatural threats. Typically mentored by an older, experienced Monster Hunter, you learn to overcome a variety of unnatural defenses and attacks, including those of undead, lycanthropes, and other creatures of horror.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Nature, or Perception. You can gain proficiency with a tool of your choice in place of one skill choice.

### Combat Superiority[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Using Superiority Dice.** You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.
* When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.
* When you make an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature only before you learn if the save succeeded or failed.
* When you make a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a hidden creature or object, or a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine if someone is lying to you, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature after seeing the total but before learning if you succeeded or failed.

### Hunter's Mysticism[]

At 3rd level, your study of the supernatural gives you a limited ability to use magic. You can cast Detect Magic as a ritual. You can cast Protection From Evil and Good, but you cannot cast it again with this feature until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

In addition, you gain the ability to speak one of the following languages of your choice: Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal.

### Monster Slayer[]

At 7th level, whenever you expend superiority dice to add to a damage roll, you can expend up to two dice instead of just one, adding both to the roll. Both dice are expended as normal. If the target of your attack is an aberration, a fey, a fiend, or an undead, you deal maximum damage with both dice, instead of rolling them.

### Improved Combat Superiority[]

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

### Relentless[]

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain one superiority die.

# Kits of Old[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old])

## Scout[]

The archetypal Scout excels at finding safe passage through dangerous regions. Scouts usually favor light armor and ranged weapons, but they are comfortable using heavier gear when faced with intense fighting.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in three of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. You can choose to gain proficiency with thieves' tools in place of one skill choice.

### Combat Superiority[]

At 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

***Superiority Dice.*** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a long or short rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

***Using Superiority Dice.*** You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a check that allows you to apply your proficiency in Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival, you can expend one superiority die to bolster the check. Add half the number rolled on the superiority die (rounding up) to your check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.
* When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.
* If you are hit by an attack while wearing light or medium armor, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.

### Natural Explorer[]

At 3rd level, you gain the ranger class feature of the same name, with the following alteration: You choose additional favored terrain types at 7th and 15th level.

### Improved Combat Superiority[]

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

### Relentless[]

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

# Fighter[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Fighter])

## Sharpshooter[]

The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

### Steady Aim[]

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you're wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Careful Eyes[]

Starting at 7th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action as a bonus action.

You also gain proficiency in the Perception, Investigation, or Survival skill (choose one).

### Close-Quarters Shooting[]

At 10th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose disadvantage on your roll.

In addition, if you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can't take reactions until the end of this turn.

### Rapid Strike[]

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

### Snap Shot[]

Starting at 18th level, you are ever ready to spring into action. If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 48)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you read certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a monk. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Dedicated Weapon[]

*2nd-level monk feature*

You train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

* The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
* You must be proficient with it.
* It must lack the heavy and special properties.

#### Ki-Fueled Attack[]

*3rd-level monk feature*

If you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.

#### Quickened Healing[]

*4th-level monk feature*

As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.

#### Focused Aim[]

*5th-level monk feature*

When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per monk level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** None
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords
* **Tools:** One type of artisan's or one musical instrument
* **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
* **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth

### Equipment[]

* (a) shortsword or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) dungeoneer's pack or (b) explorer's pack
* 10 darts

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment given by your class and background, and start with 5d4 gp.

## Unarmored Defense[]

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

## Martial Arts[]

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attacks and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

## Ki[]

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Flurry of Blows[]

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

### Patient Defense[]

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Step of the Wind[]

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

## Unarmored Movement[]

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

## Monastic Tradition[]

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

* Way of the Ascendant Dragon (Fizban's Treasury of Dragons, page 13)
* Way of the Astral Self (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 50)
* Way of the Drunken Master (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 33)
* Way of the Four Elements (Player's Handbook, page 80)
* Way of the Kensei (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 34)
* Way of the Long Death (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 130)
* Way of Mercy (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 49)
* Way of the Open Hand (Player's Handbook, page 79)
* Way of Shadow (Player's Handbook, page 80)
* Way of the Sun Soul (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 35)

## Deflect Missiles[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Slow Fall[]

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

## Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Stunning Strike[]

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

## Ki-Empowered Strikes[]

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

## Evasion[]

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Stillness of Mind[]

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

## Purity of Body[]

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

## Tongue of the Sun and Moon[]

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

## Diamond Soul[]

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

## Timeless Body[]

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

## Empty Body[]

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the Astral Projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.

## Perfect Self[]

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

## Way of the Ascendant Dragon[]

(Fizban's Treasury of Dragons, pages 13-15)

### Draconic Disciple[]

*3rd-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature*

You can channel draconic power to magnify your presence and imbue your unarmed strikes with the essence of a dragon's breath. You gain the following benefits:

**Draconic Presence.** If you fail a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can use your reaction to reroll the check, as you tap into the mighty presence of dragons. Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Draconic Strike.** When you damage a target with an unarmed strike, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

**Tongue of Dragons.** You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.

### Breath of the Dragon[]

*3rd-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature*

You can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At 11th level, the damage of this feature increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 ki points to use this feature again.

### Wings Unfurled[]

*6th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature*

When you use your Step of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Aspect of the Wyrm[]

*11th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature*

The power of your draconic spirit now radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:

**Frightful Presence.** When you create this aura, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**Resistance.** Choose a damage type when you activate this aura: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You and your allies within the aura have resistance to that damage.

Once you create this aura, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 ki points to create it again.

### Ascendant Aspect[]

*17th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature*

Your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:

**Augment Breath.** When you use your Breath of the Dragon, you can spend 1 ki point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Blindsight.** You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

**Explosive Fury.** When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).

## Way of the Astral Self[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 50)

### Arms of the Astral Self[]

*3rd-level Way of the Astral Self feature*

Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:

* You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.
* When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
* The unarmed strikes you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is force.

### Visage of the Astral Self[]

*6th-level Way of the Astral Self feature*

You can summon the visage of your astral self. As a bonus action, or as a part of the bonus action you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits:

***Astral Sight.*** You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

***Wisdom of the Spirit.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

***Word of the Spirit.*** When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only the creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.

### Body of the Astral Self[]

*11th-level Way of the Astral Self feature*

When you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits.

***Deflect Energy.*** When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

***Empowered Arms.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the Arms of the Astral Self, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.

### Awakened Astral Self[]

*17th-level Way of the Astral Self feature*

Your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.

***Armor of the Spirit.*** You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.

***Astral Barrage.*** Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack three times if all the attacks are made with your astral arms.

## Way of the Drunken Master[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 33)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with brewer's supplies if you don't already have it.

### Drunken Technique[]

At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.

### Tipsy Sway[]

Starting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

* **Leap to Your Feet:** When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
* **Redirect Attack:** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.

### Drunkard's Luck[]

Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage on the roll, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.

### Intoxicated Frenzy[]

At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.

## Way of the Four Elements[]

(Player's Handbook, page 80)

### Disciple of the Elements[]

You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.

You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

#### Casting Elemental Spells[]

Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as Burning Hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast Burning Hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.

| Monk Levels | Max. Ki Points |
| --- | --- |
| 5th-8th | 3 |
| 9th-12th | 4 |
| 13th-16th | 5 |
| 17th-20th | 6 |

### Elemental Disciplines[]

The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order. If a discipline requires a level, you must be the level in this class to learn the discipline.

* **Breath of Winter (17th-level):** You can spend 6 ki points to cast Cone of Cold.
* **Clench of the North Wind (6th-level):** You can spend 3 ki points to cast Hold Person.
* **Elemental Attunement:** You can use your action to cause one of the following effects of your choice within 30 feet:
  + Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.
  + Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
  + Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.
  + Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.
* **Eternal Mountain Defense (17th-level):** You can spend 5 ki points to cast Stoneskin, targeting yourself.
* **Fangs of the Fire Snake:** When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause tendrils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for that action, as well as the rest of the turn. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and if you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d10 fire damage.
* **Fist of Four Thunders:** You can spend 2 ki points to cast Thunderwave.
* **Fist of Unbroken Air:** As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't push it or knock it prone.
* **Flames of the Phoenix (11th-level):** You can spend 4 ki points to cast Fireball.
* **Gong of the Summit (6th-level):** You can spend 3 ki points to cast Shatter.
* **Mist Stance (11th-level):** You can spend 4 ki points to cast Gaseous Form, targeting yourself.
* **Ride the Wind (11th-level):** You can spend 4 ki points to cast Fly, targeting yourself.
* **River of Hungry Flame (17th-level):** You can spend 5 ki points to cast Wall of Fire.
* **Rush of the Gale Spirits:** You can spend 2 ki points to cast Gust of Wind.
* **Shape the Flowing River:** As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to choose an area of ice or water no larger than 30 feet on a side within 120 feet of you. You can change water to ice within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. You can't shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.
* **Sweeping Cinder Strike:** You can spend 2 ki points to cast Burning Hands.
* **Water Whip:** You can spend 2 ki points as an action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it prone.
* **Wave of Rolling Earth (17th-level):** You can spend 6 ki points to cast Wall of Stone.

## Way of the Kensei[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 34)

### Path of the Kensei[]

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits:

* **Kensei Weapons:** Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon — either melee or ranged — to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.
* **Agile Parry:** If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.
* **Kensei's Shot:** You can use a bonus action on your turn to make any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon take an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.
* **Way of the Brush:** You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies.

### One with the Blade[]

At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.

* **Magic Kensei Weapons:** Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
* **Deft Strike:** When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### Sharpen the Blade[]

At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Unerring Accuracy[]

At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

## Way of the Long Death[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 130)

### Touch of Death[]

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your study of death allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

### Hour of Reaping[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify those around you as an action, for your soul has been touched by the shadow of death. When you take this action, each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Mastery of Death[]

Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead.

### Touch of the Long Death[]

Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1 to 10 ki points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, and it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per ki point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Way of Mercy[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 49)

### Implements of Mercy[]

*3rd-level Way of Mercy feature*

You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills, and you gain proficiency with the herbalism kit.

You also gain a special mask, which you often wear when using the features of this subclass. You determine its appearance, or generate it randomly by rolling on the Merciful Mask table.

| d6 | Mask Appearance |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Raven |
| 2 | Blank and white |
| 3 | Crying visage |
| 4 | Laughing visage |
| 5 | Skull |
| 6 | Butterfly |

### Hand of Healing[]

*3rd-level Way of Mercy feature*

Your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action you can spend 1 ki point to touch a creature and restore a number of hit points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a ki point for the healing.

### Hand of Harm[]

*3rd-level Way of Mercy feature*

You use your ki to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal extra necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn.

### Physician's Touch[]

*6th-level Way of Mercy feature*

You can administer even greater cures with a touch, and if you feel it's necessary, you can use your knowledge to cause harm.

When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.

### Flurry of Healing and Harm[]

*11th-level Way of Mercy feature*

You can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use Flurry of Blows, you can now replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hand of Healing without spending ki points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the ki point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

### Hand of Ultimate Mercy[]

*17th-level Way of Mercy feature*

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 ki points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Way of the Open Hand[]

(Player's Handbook, page 79)

### Open Hand Technique[]

You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.

* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
* It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

### Wholeness of Body[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

### Tranquility[]

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a Sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

### Quivering Palm[]

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

## Way of Shadow[]

(Player's Handbook, page 80)

### Shadow Arts[]

You can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast Darkness, Darkvision, Pass Without Trace, or Silence, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the Minor Illusion cantrip if you don't already know it.

### Shadow Step[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

### Cloak of Shadows[]

By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.

### Opportunist[]

At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

## Way of the Sun Soul[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 35)

### Radiant Sun Bolt[]

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.

When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.

When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.

### Searing Arc Strike[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the Burning Hands spell as a bonus action.

You can spend additional ki points to cast Burning Hands as a higher-level spell. Each additional ki point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.

### Searing Sunburst[]

At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.

You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.

### Sun Shield[]

At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.

If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.

The material in this article is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not refined by full game design and editing. They aren't officially part of the game and aren't permitted in D&D Adventurers League events. **Ask your Dungeon Master before using any material on this page.**

If Wizards of the Coast decides to make this material official, it will be refined based on your feedback, and then it will appear in a D&D book.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Ki Features[]

*2nd-level monk feature (enhances Ki)*

When you gain the Ki feature at 2nd level, you get access to the following features.

### Distant Eye[]

When you make a ranged weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to prevent attacking at long range from imposing disadvantage on your attack rolls until the end of the current turn.

# Monastic Traditions[]

(Monk: Monastic Traditions])

## Way of Tranquility[]

Monks of the Way of Tranquility see violence as a last resort. They use diplomacy, mercy, and understanding to resolve conflicts. If pushed, though, they are capable warriors who can bring an end to the unjust or cruel folk who refuse to listen to reason. When adventuring, these monks make excellent diplomats. They are also skilled in the healing arts, and can preserve their allies in the face of daunting foes.

### Path of Tranquility[]

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can become an island of calm in even the most chaotic of situations. With this feature, you can cast the Sanctuary spell on yourself, no material component required, and it lasts up to 8 hours. Its saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this effect for 1 hour.

Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again for 1 minute.

### Healing Hands[]

Your mystical touch can heal wounds. Starting at 3rd level, you have a pool of magical healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your monk level x 10.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

Instead of healing the creature, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Healing Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Emissary of Peace[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to diffuse violent situations. Whenever you make a Charisma check to calm violent emotions or to counsel peace, you have advantage on the roll. You must make this entreaty in good faith; it doesn't apply if proficiency in the Deception or Intimidation skill applies to your check.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance or Persuasion skill (choose one).

### Douse the Flames of War[]

At 11th level, you gain the ability to temporarily extinguish a creature's violent impulses. As an action, you can touch a creature, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. The target automatically succeeds if it's missing any of its hit points. If the target fails the save, it can't attack for 1 minute. During that time, it also can't cast spells that deal damage or that force someone to make a saving throw.

This effect ends if the target is attacked, takes damage, or is forced to make a saving throw or if the target witnesses any of those things happening to its allies.

### Anger of a Gentle Soul[]

At 17th level, you gain the ability to visit vengeance on someone who fells others. If you see a creature reduce another creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to all damage rolls against the aggressor until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your monk level.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Psionics[]

As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.

### Psionic Talents[]

A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.

### Psionic Disciplines[]

A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.

At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.

In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.

* Avatar Disciplines
* Awakened Disciplines
* Immortal Disciplines
* Nomad Disciplines
* Wu Jen Disciplines

### Psi Points[]

You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.

The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.

### Psi Limit[]

Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.

### Psychic Focus[]

You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.

You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.

### Psionic Ability[]

Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.

**Discipline save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Discipline attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Mystic Order[]

At 1st level, you choose a Mystic Order from the list of available orders. Each order specializes in a specific approach to psionics.

Your order gives you features when you choose it at 1st level and additional features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.

* Order of the Avatar (Avatar Disciplines)
* Order of the Awakened (Awakened Disciplines)
* Order of the Immortal (Immortal Disciplines)
* Order of the Nomad (Nomad Disciplines)
* Order of the Soul Knife
* Order of the Wu Jen (Wu Jen Disciplines)

## Mystical Recovery[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can draw vigor from the psi energy you use to power your psionic disciplines.

Immediately after you spend psi points on a psionic discipline, you can take a bonus action to regain hit points equal to the number of psi points you spent.

## Telepathy[]

At 2nd level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Proficiency Versatility[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants) (enhances Ability Score Improvement)

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature from your class, you can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn't be from the class).

This change represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.

## Strength of Mind[]

Even the simplest psionic technique requires a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding allows you to alter your defenses to better deal with threats.

Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.

## Potent Psionics[]

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with psychic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to that target. When you reach 14th level, this extra damage increases to 2d8.

In addition, you add your Intelligence modifier to any damage roll you make for a psionic talent.

## Consumptive Power[]

At 10th level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your physical durability in exchange for psionic power. When activating a psionic discipline, you can pay its psi point cost with your hit points, instead of using any psi points. Your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This reduction can't be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Psionic Mastery[]

Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can't also spend your normal psi points on these disciplines; you can spend only the special points gained from this feature. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven't spent.

If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require concentration, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already concentrating on, and if you begin concentrating on an effect that doesn't use these special points, the disciplines end that you're concentrating on.

At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11.

You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.

## Psionic Body[]

At 20th level, your mastery of psionic power causes your mind to transcend the body. Your physical form is infused with psionic energy. You gain the following benefits:

* You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You no longer age.
* You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.
* If you die, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you discorporate with 0 hit points, instead of dying, and you fall unconscious. You and your gear disappear. You appear at a spot of your choice 1d3 days later on the plane of existence where you died, having gained the benefits of one long rest.

## Order of the Avatar[]

### Avatar of Healing[]

Beginning at 6th level, you project an aura of resilience. While you aren't incapacitated, each ally within 30 feet of you who can see you regains additional hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0) whenever they regain hit points from a psionic discipline.

### Psionic Investigation[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your mind to read the psionic imprint left on an object. If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.

You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't use other senses.

Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Psionic Surge[]

Starting at 6th level, you can overload your psychic focus to batter down an opponent's defenses. You can impose disadvantage on a target's saving throw against a discipline or talent you use, but at the cost of using your psychic focus. Your psychic focus immediately ends if it's active, and you can't use it until you finish a short or long rest.

You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus.

### Spectral Form[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to become a ghostly figure of psionic energy. As an action, you can transform into a transparent, ghostly version of yourself. While in this form, you have resistance to all damage, move at half speed, and can pass through objects and creatures while moving but can't willingly end your movement in their spaces. The form lasts for 10 minutes or until you use an action to end it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Order of the Immortal[]

### Bonus Disciplines[]

At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Immortal disciplines.

### Immortal Durability[]

In addition, while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, your base AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

### Psionic Resilience[]

Starting at 3rd level, your psionic energy grants you extraordinary fortitude. At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0) if you have at least 1 hit point.

### Surge of Health[]

Starting at 6th level, you can draw on your psychic focus to escape death's grasp. As a reaction when you take damage, you can halve that damage against you. Your psychic focus immediately ends if it's active, and you can't use it until you finish a short or long rest.

You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus.

### Immortal Will[]

Starting at 14th level, you can draw on your reserves of psionic power to survive beyond death. At the end of your turn while at 0 hit points, you can spend 5 psi points to immediately regain a number of hit points equal to your mystic level + your Constitution modifier.

## Order of the Nomad[]

### Bonus Disciplines[]

At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Nomad disciplines.

### Breadth of Knowledge[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to extend your knowledge. When you finish a long rest, you gain two proficiencies of your choice: two tools, two skills, or one of each. You can replace one or both of these selections with languages. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

### Memory of One Thousand Steps[]

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use psionics to recall your steps. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can teleport to an unoccupied space that you occupied since the start of your last turn, and the attack misses you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Superior Teleportation[]

At 6th level, you gain a superior talent for teleportation. When you use a psionic discipline to teleport any distance, you can increase that distance by up to 10 feet.

### Effortless Journey[]

Starting at 14th level, your mind can mystically move your body. Once on each of your turns, you can forfeit up to 30 feet of your movement to teleport the distance you forfeited. You must teleport to an unoccupied space you can see.

## Order of the Soul Knife[]

### Martial Training[]

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and martial weapons.

### Soul Knife[]

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to manifest a blade of psychic energy. As a bonus action, you create scintillating knives of energy that project from both of your fists. You can't hold anything in your hands while manifesting these blades. You can dismiss them as a bonus action.

For you, a soul knife is a martial melee weapon with the light and finesse properties. It deals 1d8 psychic damage on a hit.

As a bonus action, you can prepare to use the blades to parry; you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until you are incapacitated.

### Hone the Blade[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can spend psi points to augment your soul knife's attack rolls and damage. You gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with your soul knives depending on the number of psi points spent, as shown on the table below. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes.

| Psi Points | Damage and Attack |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | +1 |
| 5 | +2 |
| 7 | +4 |

### Consumptive Knife[]

Starting at 6th level, whenever you slay an enemy creature with a soul knife attack, you immediately regain 2 psi points.

### Phantom Knife[]

Starting at 14th level, you can make an attack that phases through most defenses. As an action, you can make one attack with your soul knife. Treat the target's AC as 10 against this attack, regardless of the target's actual AC.

### Hermit's Study[]

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, or Survival.

### Elemental Attunement[]

Starting at 3rd level, when a creature's resistance reduces the damage dealt by a psionic discipline of yours, you can spend 1 psi point to cause that use of the discipline to ignore the creature's resistance. You can't spend this point if doing so would increase the discipline's cost above your psi limit.

### Arcane Dabbler[]

At 6th level, you learn three wizard spells of your choice and always have them prepared. The spells must be of 1st through 3rd level.

As a bonus action, you can spend psi points to create spell slots that you can use to cast these spells, as well as other spells you are capable of casting. The psi-point cost of each spell slot is detailed on the table below.

| Spell Slot Level | Psi Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |

The spell slot remains until you use it or finish a long rest. You must observe your psi limit when spending psi points to create a spell slot.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace on of the chosen wizard spells with a different wizard spell of 1st through 3rd level.

### Elemental Mastery[]

Starting at 14th level, if you have resistance to a type of damage, you can spend 2 psi points as a reaction when you take damage of that type to ignore that damage; you gain immunity to that damage type until the end of your next turn.

## Psionic Disciplines and Talents[]

Psionic talents and disciplines are the heart of a mystic's craft. They are the mental exercises and psionic formulae used to forge will into tangible, magical effects.

Psionic disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators' specialties. However, a mystic can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order.

### Using a Discipline[]

Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.

The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.

### Psychic Focus[]

The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.

### Effect Options and Psi Points[]

A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.

Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.

Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.

### Components[]

Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.

### Duration[]

An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.

* **Instantaneous:** If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.
* **Concentration:** Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with "conc." after the option's psi point cost. The "conc." notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says "conc., 1 min.," you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute.

:   Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time.

### Targets and Areas of Effect[]

Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect.

### Saving Throws and Attack Rolls[]

If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.

Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.

### Combining Psionic Effects[]

The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect — usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect — applies while the durations of the effects overlap.

Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule.

## Avatar Disciplines[]

### Crown of Despair[]

**Psychic Focus:** While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

* **Crowned in Sorrow (1–7 psi):** As an action, one creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage per psi point spent, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
* **Call to Inaction (2 psi; conc., 10 min.):** If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to seed it with overwhelming ennui. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, it sits and is incapacitated until your concentration ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.
* **Visions of Despair (3 psi):** As an action, you force one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.
* **Dolorous Mind (5 psi; conc., 1 min.):** As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 until your concentration ends. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Crown of Disgust[]

**Psychic Focus:** While you are focused on this discipline, the area in a 5-foot radius around you is difficult terrain for any enemy that isn't immune to being frightened.

* **Eye of Horror (1–7 psi):** As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent and can't move closer to you until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
* **Wall of Repulsion (3 psi; conc., 10 min.):** As an action, you create an invisible, insubstantial wall of energy within 60 feet of you that is up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Any creature attempting to move through it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't move through the wall until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature can pass through it. A creature must make this save whenever it attempts to pass through the wall, whether willingly or unwillingly.
* **Visions of Disgust (5 psi; conc., 1 min.):** You cause a creature to regard all other beings as horrid, alien entities. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d6 psychic damage, and until your concentration ends, it takes 1d6 psychic damage per creature within 5 feet of it at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes only half the initial damage and suffers none of the other effects.
* **World of Horror (7 psi; conc., 1 min.):** As an action, choose up to six creatures within 60 feet of you. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 psychic damage, and it is frightened until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. While frightened by this effect, a target's speed is reduced to 0, and the target can use its action, and any bonus action it might have, only to make melee attacks. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Crown of Rage[]

**Psychic Focus:** While you are focused on this discipline, any enemy within 5 feet of you that makes a melee attack roll against creatures other than you does so with disadvantage.

* **Primal Fury (1–7 psi):** As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent on this ability and immediately use its reaction to move its speed in a straight line toward its nearest enemy. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.
* **Fighting Words (2 psi; conc., 10 min.):** If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to leave a simmering violence in its mind. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature before your concentration ends, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward. Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.
* **Mindless Courage (2 psi):** You cause a creature's bloodlust to overcome its sense of preservation. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until the end of your next turn, it can't willingly move unless its movement brings it closer to its nearest enemy that it can see. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.
* **Punishing Fury (5 psi; conc., 1 min.):** You cause a creature's rage to grow so hot that it attacks without heeding its own safety. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until your concentration ends, any creature within 5 feet of it can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it whenever the target makes a melee attack. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.

### Mantle of Command[]

**Psychic Focus:** While focused on this discipline, when you end your turn and didn't move during it, you can use your reaction to allow one ally you can see within 30 feet of you to move up to half their speed, following a path of your choice. To move in this way, the ally mustn't be incapacitated.

* **Coordinated Movement (2 psi):** As a bonus action, choose up to five allies you can see within 60 feet of you. Each of those allies can use their reaction to move up to half their speed, following a path of your choice.
* **Commander's Sight (2 psi; conc., 1 rnd.):** As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, your allies have advantage on attack rolls against that target.
* **Command to Strike (3 psi):** As an action, choose one ally you can see within 60 feet of you. That ally can use their reaction to immediately take the Attack action. You choose the targets.
* **Strategic Mind (5 psi; conc., 1 min.):** As an action, you exert an aura of trust and command that unites your allies into a cohesive unit. Until your concentration ends, any ally within 60 feet of you on their turn can, as a bonus action, take the Dash or Disengage action or roll a d4 and add the number rolled to each attack roll they make that turn.
* **Overwhelming Attack (7 psi):** As an action, choose up to five allies you can see within 60 feet of you. Each of those allies can use their reaction to take the Attack action. You choose the targets of the attacks.

### Mantle of Courage[]

**Psychic Focus:** While focused on this discipline, you and allies within 10 feet of you who can see you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

* **Incite Courage (2 psi):** As a bonus action, choose up to six creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. If any of those creatures is frightened, that condition ends on that creature.
* **Aura of Victory (1–7 psi; conc., 10 min.):** As a bonus action, you project psionic energy until your concentration ends. The energy fortifies you and your allies when your enemies are felled; whenever an enemy you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you and each of your allies within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to double the psi points spent to activate this effect
* **Pillar of Confidence (6 psi; conc., 1 rnd.):** As an action, you and up to five creatures you can see within 60 feet of you each gain one extra action to use on your individual turns. The action goes away if not used before the end of your next turn. The action can be used only to make one weapon attack or to take the Dash or Disengage action.

### Mantle of Fear[]

**Psychic Focus:** While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

If you concentrate for this option's full duration, you then gain a general understanding of the creature's current location. You learn the region, city, town, village, or district where it is, pinpointing an area between 1 and 3 miles on a side (DM's choice). If the creature is on another plane of existence, you instead learn which plane.

* **Psychic Speech (5 psi):** As an action, you attune your mind to the psychic imprint of all language. For 1 hour, you gain the ability to understand any language you hear or attempt to read. In addition, when you speak, all creatures that can understand a language understand what you say, regardless of what language you use.
* **Wandering Eye (6 psi; conc., 1 hr.):** As an action, you create a psychic sensor within 60 feet of you. The sensor lasts until your concentration ends. The sensor is invisible and hovers in the air. You mentally receive visual information from it, which has normal vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The sensor can look in all directions. As an action, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
* **Phasing Eye (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.):** As Wandering Eye above, except the eye can move through solid objects but can't end its movement in one. If it does so, the effect immediately ends.

### Nomadic Step[]

**Psychic Focus:** After you teleport on your turn while focused on this discipline, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, as you are propelled by the magic of your teleportation. You can receive this increase only once per turn.

* **Nomad's Gate (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.):** As an action, you create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you. You create an identical cube at any point of your choice within 1 mile that you have viewed within the past 24 hours.

The teleportation fails if there is no space for the creature to appear in.

This communication can occur until the end of the current turn.

You also gain access to one memory of the target's choice, gaining perfect recall of one thing it saw or did.

The object falls to the ground at the end of your turn if you leave it suspended in midair.

### Psychic Hammer[]

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage.

You can't lift the target off the ground unless it is already airborne or underwater.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 52)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a paladin. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Additional Paladin Spells[]

*2nd-level paladin feature*

The spells in the following list expand the paladin spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Ritual | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2nd | Gentle Repose | Necromancy | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Yes |  | PHB 245 |
| 2nd | Prayer of Healing | Evocation | 10 minutes | V |  |  |  | PHB 267 |
| 2nd | Warding Bond | Abjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 50gp |  |  | PHB 287 |
| 3rd | Spirit Shroud | Necromancy | 1 bonus action | V, S |  |  | Yes | TCE 108 |
| 5th | Summon Celestial | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 500gp |  | Yes | TCE 110 |

#### Fighting Style Options[]

*2nd-level paladin feature*

When you choose a fighting style, the following styles are added to your list of options.

***Blessed Warrior.*** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.

***Blind Fighting.*** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

***Interception.*** When a creature you can see hits a target other than you within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

#### Harness Divine Power[]

*3rd-level paladin feature*

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class. 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Martial Versatility[]

*4th-level paladin feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per paladin level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per paladin level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

### Equipment[]

* (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
* (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
* (a) a Priest's Pack or (b) an Explorer's Pack
* Chain mail and a holy symbol

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Divine Sense[]

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Lay on Hands[]

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Fighting Style[]

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

## Spellcasting[]

By 2nd level, you can cast paladin spells.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

## Divine Smite[]

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

## Divine Health[]

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

## Sacred Oath[]

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

* Oath of the Ancients (Player's Handbook, page 86)
* Oath of Conquest (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 37)
* Oath of the Crown (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 132)
* Oath of Devotion (Player's Handbook, page 85)
* Oath of Glory (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 53; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 29)
* Oath of Redemption (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 38)
* Oath of Vengeance (Player's Handbook, page 87)
* Oath of the Watchers (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 54)
* Oathbreaker (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 97)

### Oath Spells[]

Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

### Breaking Your Oath[]

A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress their oath.

A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares their faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.

If a paladin willfully violates their oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker or Oath of Treachery paladin option.

### Channel Divinity[]

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Aura of Protection[]

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Aura of Courage[]

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Improved Divine Smite[]

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

## Cleansing Touch[]

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Oath of the Ancients[]

(Player's Handbook, page 86)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Ensnaring Strike, Speak With Animals |
| 5th | Misty Step, Moonbeam |
| 9th | Plant Growth, Protection From Energy |
| 13th | Ice Storm, Stoneskin |
| 17th | Commune With Nature, Tree Stride |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Nature's Wrath:** You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.
* **Turn the Faithless:** You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

:   A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
:   If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

### Aura of Warding[]

Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Undying Sentinel[]

Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.

### Elder Champion[]

At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.

Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

* At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
* Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
* Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Conquest[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 37)

### Oath of Conquest Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Armor of Agathys, Command |
| 5th | Hold Person, Spiritual Weapon |
| 9th | Bestow Curse, Fear |
| 13th | Dominate Beast, Stoneskin |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Dominate Person |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Conquering Presence:** You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
* **Guided Strike:** You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Aura of Conquest[]

Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Scornful Rebuke[]

Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not incapacitated.

### Invincible Conqueror[]

At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You have resistance to all damage.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
* Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of the Crown[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 132)

| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Command, Compelled Duel |
| 5th | Warding Bond, Zone of Truth |
| 9th | Aura of Vitality, Spirit Guardians |
| 13th | Banishment, Guardian of Faith |
| 17th | Circle of Power, Geas |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Champion Challenge:** As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you.
* **Turn the Tide:** As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.

### Divine Allegiance[]

Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

### Unyielding Spirit[]

Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.

### Exalted Champion[]

At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour:

* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
* Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.
* You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 ft. of you.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Devotion[]

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Sacred Weapon:** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

:   You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

* **Turn the Unholy:** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

:   A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Aura of Devotion[]

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Purity of Spirit[]

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a Protection From Evil and Good spell.

### Holy Nimbus[]

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Glory[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 53; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 29)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |

| 9th | Haste, Protection From Energy |
| 13th | Compulsion, Freedom of Movement |
| 17th | Commune, Flame Strike |

### Channel Divinity[]

*3rd-level Oath of Glory feature*

You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Di­vinity works.

* **Peerless Athlete:** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).
* **Inspiring Smite:** Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

### Aura of Alacrity[]

*7th- and 18th-level Oath of Glory feature*

You emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 10 feet.

### Glorious Defense[]

*15th-level Oath of Glory feature*

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Living Legend[]

*20th-level Oath of Glory feature*

You can empower yourself with the legends — whether true or exaggerated — of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.
* Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
* If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

## Oath of Redemption[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 38)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Sanctuary, Sleep |
| 5th | Calm Emotions, Hold Person |
| 9th | Counterspell, Hypnotic Pattern |
| 13th | Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, Stoneskin |
| 17th | Hold Monster, Wall of Force |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Emissary of Peace:** You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.
* **Rebuke the Violent:** You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

### Aura of the Guardian[]

Starting at 7th level, you can shield others from harm at the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Protective Spirit[]

Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your wounds in battle. You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren't incapacitated.

### Emissary of Redemption[]

At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which gives you two benefits:

* You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).
* Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack.

If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Vengeance[]

(Player's Handbook, page 87)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Bane, Hunter's Mark |
| 5th | Hold Person, Misty Step |
| 9th | Haste, Protection From Energy |
| 13th | Banishment, Dimension Door |
| 17th | Hold Monster, Scrying |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Abjure Enemy:** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.

:   On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
:   On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

* **Vow of Enmity:** As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.

### Relentless Avenger[]

By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Soul of Vengeance[]

Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.

### Avenging Angel[]

At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:

* Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
* You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of the Watchers[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 54)

### Oath Spells[]

*3rd-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Watchers table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Alarm, Detect Magic |
| 5th | Moonbeam, See Invisibility |
| 9th | Counterspell, Nondetection |
| 13th | Aura of Purity, Banishment |
| 17th | Hold Monster, Scrying |

### Channel Divinity[]

*3rd-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You gain the following Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

***Watcher's Will.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to invest your presence with the warding power of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Abjure the Extraplanar.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an action, you present your holy symbol and each aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can take the Dodge action.

### Aura of the Sentinel[]

*7th-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You emit an aura of alertness while you aren't incapacitated. When you and any creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you roll initiative, you all gain a bonus to initiative equal to your proficiency bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Vigilant Rebuke[]

*15th-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You've learned how to chastise anyone who dares wield beguilements against you and your wards. Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to deal 2d8 + your Charisma modifier force damage to the creature that forced the saving throw.

### Mortal Bulwark[]

*20th-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You manifest a spark of divine power in defense of the mortal realms. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.
* You have advantage on attack rolls against aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends.
* When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

## Oathbreaker[]

(Dungeon Master's Guide, page 97)

### Oathbreaker Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Hellish Rebuke, Inflict Wounds |
| 5th | Crown of Madness, Darkness |
| 9th | Animate Dead, Bestow Curse |
| 13th | Blight, Confusion |
| 17th | Contagion, Dominate Person |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Control Undead:** As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect.
* **Dreadful Aspect:** As an action, you channel the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see you. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.

### Aura of Hate[]

Starting at 7th level, you, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of you, gain a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Supernatural Resistance[]

At 15th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

### Dread Lord[]

At 20th level, you can, as an action, surround yourself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around you to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by you starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, you and creatures you choose in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.

While the aura lasts, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. You make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + your Charisma modifier.

After activating the aura, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Waterborne Adventures[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures])

## Fighting Style[]

### Mariner[]

As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

# Light, Dark, Underdark![]

(Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!])

## Fighting Style[]

### Close Quarters Shooter[]

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

### Tunnel Fighter[]

You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Fighting Style Options[]

*2nd-level paladin feature (enhances Fighting Style)*

### Thrown Weapon Fighting[]

You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.

### Unarmed Fighter[]

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.

# Sacred Oaths[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Sacred Oaths])

## Oath of Treachery[]

The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure.

Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery.

***Fallen Paladins.*** The Oath of Treachery is an option for the paladin who has strayed from another Sacred Oath or who has rejected the traditional paladin life. This option exists alongside the Oathbreaker. DMs are free to use either option to model villainous or fallen paladins.

If you switch to this oath from another one, replace all of the previous oath's features with the features of this one, and if you renounce this oath, replace its features with the features of the new one.

### Tenets of Treachery[]

A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard's overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others.

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Charm Person, Expeditious Retreat |
| 5th | Invisibility, Mirror Image |
| 9th | Gaseous Form, Haste |
| 13th | Confusion, Greater Invisibility |
| 17th | Dominate Person, Passwall |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* ***Conjure Duplicate.*** As an action, you create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, doesn't occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you.

:   For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.

* ***Poison Strike.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your paladin level, or 20 + your paladin level if you had advantage on the attack roll.

### Aura of Treachery[]

Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of discord, which gives you the following benefits.

* ***Cull the Herd.*** You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.
* ***Treacherous Strike.*** If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed.

:   You can use this ability three times. You regain expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Blackguard's Escape[]

At 15th level, you have the ability to slip away from your foes. Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Icon of Deceit[]

At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of deceit, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You are invisible.
* If a creature damages you on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren't incapacitated when it takes the action. A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.
* If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain a bonus to its damage roll equal to your paladin level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 56)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a ranger. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decided whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

#### Deft Explorer[]

*1st-level ranger feature, which replaces the Natural Explorer feature*

You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.

***Canny (1st Level).*** Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill. You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.

***Roving (6th Level).*** Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

***Tireless (10th Level).*** As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.

#### Favored Foe[]

*1st-level ranger feature, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature*

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you can increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.

#### Additional Ranger Spells[]

*2nd-level ranger feature*

The spells in the following list expand the ranger spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Save | Ritual | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | Entangle | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S |  | Strength |  | Yes | PHB 238 |
| 1st | Searing Smite | Evocation | 1 bonus action | V |  | Constitution |  | Yes | PHB 274 |
| 2nd | Aid | Abjuration | 1 action | V, S, M |  |  |  |  | PHB 211 |
| 2nd | Enhance Ability | Transmutation | 1 action | V, S, M |  |  |  | Yes | PHB 237 |
| 2nd | Gust of Wind | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Strength |  | Yes | PHB 248 |
| 2nd | Magic Weapon | Transmutation | 1 bonus action | V, S |  |  |  | Yes | PHB 257 |
| 2nd | Summon Beast | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 200gp |  |  | Yes | TCE 109 |
| 3rd | Elemental Weapon | Transmutation | 1 action | V, S |  |  |  | Yes | PHB 237 |
| 3rd | Meld Into Stone | Transmutation | 1 action | V, S |  |  | Yes |  | PHB 259 |
| 3rd | Revivify | Necromancy | 1 action | V, S, M | 300gp |  |  |  | PHB 272 |
| 3rd | Summon Fey | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 300gp |  |  | Yes | TCE 112 |
| 4th | Dominate Beast | Enchantment | 1 action | V, S |  | Wisdom |  | Yes | PHB 234 |
| 4th | Summon Elemental | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 400gp |  |  | Yes | TCE 111 |
| 5th | Greater Restoration | Abjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 100gp |  |  |  | PHB 246 |

#### Fighting Style Options[]

*2nd-level ranger feature*

When you choose a fighting style, the following styles are added to your list of options.

***Blind Fighting.*** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

***Druidic Warrior.*** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

***Thrown Weapon Fighting.*** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Spellcasting Focus[]

*2nd-level ranger feature*

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

#### Primal Awareness[]

*3rd-level ranger feature, which replaces the Primeval Awareness feature*

You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| Ranger Level | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Speak With Animals |
| 5th | Beast Sense |
| 9th | Speak With Plants |
| 13th | Locate Creature |
| 17th | Commune With Nature |

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Martial Versatility[]

*4th-level ranger feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

#### Nature's Veil[]

*10th-level ranger feature, which replaces the Hide in Plain Sight feature*

You draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per ranger level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per ranger level after 1st

* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
* **Skills:** Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival

* (a) a Dungeoneer's pack or (b) an Explorer's pack
* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Favored Enemy[]

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

## Natural Explorer[]

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

## Fighting Style[]

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

## Spellcasting[]

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

### Spell Slots[]

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher[]

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

## Ranger Archetype[]

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

* Beast Master (Player's Handbook, page 93)
* Drakewarden (Fizban's Treasury of Dragons, page 15)
* Fey Wanderer (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 58)
* Gloom Stalker (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 41)
* Horizon Walker (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 42)
* Hunter (Player's Handbook, page 93)
* Monster Slayer (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 43)
* Swarmkeeper (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 59)

### Extra Attack[]

If you're playing the revised ranger introduced in Unearthed Arcana, you gain the Extra Attack feature at level 5 if your subclass doesn't have a different feature granted at level 5.

## Primeval Awareness[]

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Land's Stride[]

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

## Hide in Plain Sight[]

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

## Vanish[]

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

## Feral Senses[]

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

## Foe Slayer[]

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Beast Master[]

(Player's Handbook, page 93)

### Ranger's Companion[]

You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, the beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.

If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

Like any creature, the beast can spend hit dice during a short rest.

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.

### Exceptional Training[]

Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn. In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Bestial Fury[]

Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.

### Share Spells[]

Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 61)

The Beast Master in the Player's Handbook forms a mystical bond with an animal. As an alternative, a Beast Master can take the feature below to form a bond with a special primal beast instead.

#### Primal Companion[]

*3rd-level Beast Master feature, which replaces the Ranger's Companion feature*

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Choose its stat block — Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky — which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

When you finish a long rest, you can summon a different primal beast. The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears. The beast also vanishes if you die.

## Drakewarden[]

(Fizban's Treasury of Dragons, page 15)

### Draconic Gift[]

*3rd-level Drakewarden feature*

The bond you share with your drake creates a connection to dragonkind, granting you understanding and empowering your presence. You gain the following benefits:

**Thaumaturgy.** You learn the Thaumaturgy cantrip, which is a ranger spell for you.

**Tongue of Dragons.** You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.

### Drake Companion[]

*3rd-level Drakewarden feature*

As an action, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you.

The drake is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Drake Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the drake can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the drake vanishes.

Once you summon the drake, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon it.

### Bond of Fang and Scale[]

*7th-level Drakewarden feature*

The bond you share with your drake intensifies, protecting you and stoking the drake's fury. When you summon your drake, it grows wings on its back and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.

In addition, while your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:

**Drake Mount.** The drake grows to Medium size. Reflecting your special bond, you can use the drake as a mount if your size is Medium or smaller. While you are riding your drake, it can't use the flying speed of this feature.

**Magic Fang.** The drake's Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for the drake's Draconic Essence.

**Resistance.** You gain resistance to the damage type chosen for the drake's Draconic Essence.

### Drake's Breath[]

*11th-level Drakewarden feature*

As an action, you can exhale a 30-foot cone of damaging breath or cause your drake to exhale it. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice doesn't have to match your drake's Draconic Essence). Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

This damage increases to 10d6 when you reach 15th level in this class.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.

### Perfected Bond[]

*15th-level Drakewarden feature*

Your bond to your drake reaches the pinnacle of its power. While your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:

**Empowered Bite.** The drake's Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence (for a total of 2d6 extra damage).

**Large Drake.** The drake grows to Large size. When you ride your drake, it is no longer prohibited from using the flying speed of Bond of Fang and Scale.

**Reflexive Resistance.** When either you or the drake takes damage while you're within 30 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Fey Wanderer[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 58)

### Dreadful Strikes[]

*3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature*

You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn.

The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 11th level in this class.

### Fey Wanderer Magic[]

*3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature*

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Wanderer Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Charm Person |
| 5th | Misty Step |
| 9th | Dispel Magic |
| 13th | Dimension Door |
| 17th | Mislead |

You also possess a preternatural blessing from a fey ally or a place of fey power. Choose your blessing from the Feywild Gifts table or determine it randomly.

| d6 | Gift |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Illusory butterflies flutter around you while you take a short or long rest. |
| 2 | Fresh, seasonal flowers sprout from your hair each dawn. |
| 3 | You faintly smell of cinnamon, lavender, nutmeg, or another comforting herb or spice. |
| 4 | Your shadow dances while no one is looking directly at it. |
| 5 | Horns or antlers sprout from your head. |
| 6 | Your skin and hair change color to match the season at each dawn. |

### Otherworldly Glamour[]

*3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature*

Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.

### Beguiling Twist[]

*7th-level Fey Wanderer feature*

The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. In addition, whenever you or a creature you can see within 120 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can use your reaction to force a different creature you can see within 120 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the spell fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

### Fey Reinforcements[]

*11th-level Fey Wanderer feature*

The royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings: you know Summon Fey. It doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

### Misty Wanderer[]

*15th-level Fey Wanderer feature*

You can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye: you can cast Misty Step without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you cast Misty Step, you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space.

## Gloom Stalker[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 41)

### Gloom Stalker Magic[]

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| 5th | Rope Trick |
| 9th | Fear |
| 13th | Greater Invisibility |

### Dread Ambusher[]

At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

### Umbral Sight[]

At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

### Iron Mind[]

By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Stalker's Flurry[]

At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

### Shadowy Dodge[]

Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

## Horizon Walker[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 42)

### Horizon Walker Magic[]

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Detect Portal[]

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically sense the presence of a planar portal. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Planar Warrior[]

At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks.

As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Ethereal Step[]

At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action, you can cast the Etherealness spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.

### Distant Strike[]

At 11th level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in the blink of an eye. When you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.

If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.

### Spectral Defense[]

At 15th level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to all of that attack's damage on this turn.

## Hunter[]

(Player's Handbook, page 93)

### Hunter's Prey[]

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horde Breaker.

* **Evasion:** You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
* **Stand Against the Tide:** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.
* **Uncanny Dodge:** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

## Monster Slayer[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 43)

### Monster Slayer Magic[]

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Monster Slayer Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Slayer's Prey[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.

### Supernatural Defense[]

At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.

### Magic-User's Nemesis[]

At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else's magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Slayer's Counter[]

At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects.

## Swarmkeeper[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 59)

### Gathered Swarm[]

*3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature*

A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. While you're alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance, or you generate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appearance table.

| d4 | Appearance |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Swarming insects |
| 2 | Miniature twig blights |
| 3 | Fluttering birds |
| 4 | Playful pixies |

Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:

* The attack's target takes 1d6 piercing damage from the swarm.
* The attack's target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.
* You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.

### Swarmkeeper Magic[]

*3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature*

You learn the Mage Hand cantrip if you don't already know it. When you cast it, the hand takes the form of your swarming nature spirits.
You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Swarmkeeper Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Faerie Fire, Mage Hand |
| 5th | Web |
| 9th | Gaseous Form |
| 13th | Arcane Eye |
| 17th | Insect Plague |

### Writhing Tide[]

*7th-level Swarmkeeper feature*

You can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Mighty Swarm[]

*11th-level Swarmkeeper feature*

Your Gathered Swarm grows mightier in the following ways:

* The damage of Gathered Swarm increases to 1d8.
* If a creature fails its saving throw against being moved by Gathered Swarm, you can also cause the swarm to knock the creature prone.
* When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives you half cover until the start of your next turn.

### Swarming Dispersal[]

*15th-level Swarmkeeper feature*

You can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding danger. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage. You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, where you reappear with the swarm.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Waterborne Adventures[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures])

## Fighting Style[]

### Mariner[]

As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

# Light, Dark, Underdark![]

(Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!])

## Fighting Style[]

### Close Quarters Shooter[]

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

### Tunnel Fighter[]

You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Favored Foe[]

*1st-level ranger feature (replaces Favored Enemy)*

You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the Hunter's Mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a certain number of times without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration — a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, Hunter's Mark doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

## Fighting Style Options[]

*2nd-level ranger feature (enhances Fighting Style)*

### Interception[]

When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

### Unarmed Fighter[]

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.

## Spell Versatility[]

*2nd-level ranger feature (enhances Spellcasting)*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the ranger spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

# Ranger & Rogue[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Ranger & Rogue])

## Primeval Guardian[]

Rangers of the Primeval Guardian Conclave follow an ancient tradition rooted in powerful druidic magic. These rangers learn to become one with nature, allowing them to channel the aspects of various beasts and plants in order to overcome their foes.

These rangers dwell in the elder forests of the world. They venture out only rarely, as they consider it their sacred duty to protect the druidic groves and ancient trees that saw the earliest days of the world.

### Guardian Magic[]

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Primeval Guardian Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Entangle |
| 5th | Enhance Ability |
| 9th | Conjure Animals |
| 13th | Giant Insect |
| 17th | Insect Plague |

### Guardian Soul[]

Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to temporarily grow and take on the appearance of a treelike person, covered with leaves and bark. As a bonus action, you assume this guardian form, which lasts until you end it as a bonus action or until you are incapacitated.

You undergo the following changes while in your guardian form:

* Your size becomes Large, unless you were larger.
* Any speed you have becomes 5 feet, unless the speed was lower.
* Your reach increases by 5 feet.
* You gain a number of temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns. The number equals half your ranger level. When the form ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.

### Piercing Thorns[]

At 3rd level, your command of primal magic allows you to enhance your attacks with thorns. Once during each of your turns, you can deal an additional 1d6 piercing damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack.

### Ancient Fortitude[]

At 7th level, you gain the endurance of the ancient forests. Your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2 per ranger level when you assume your guardian form. This increase lasts until you leave the form; your hit point maximum then returns to normal, but your current hit points remain the same, unless they must decrease to abide by your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Rooted Defense[]

At 11th level, you gain the ability to twist and turn the ground beneath you. While you are in your guardian form, the ground within 30 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.

### Guardian Aura[]

Starting at 15th level, your guardian form emanates a magical aura that fortifies your injured allies. When any ally starts their turn within 30 feet of your guardian form, that ally regains a number of hit points equal to half your ranger level. This aura has no effect on a creature that has half or more of its hit points, and it has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per ranger level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per ranger level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** All light, medium, shields
* **Weapons:** All simple, martial
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
* **Skills:** Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival

### Equipment[]

* (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor
* (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons
* (a) a Dungeoneer's pack or (b) an Explorer's pack
* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Favored Enemy[]

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.

Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.

## Natural Explorer[]

You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:

* You ignore difficult terrain.
* You have advantage on initiative rolls.
* On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:

* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

## Spellcasting[]

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

### Spell Slots[]

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher[]

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

## Fighting Style[]

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Mariner (Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures):** As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Close Quarters Shooter (Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!):** You are trained in making ranged attack at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
* **Tunnel Fighter (Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!):** You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.

## Primeval Awareness[]

Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.

You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.

Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures' general direction and distance (in miles) from you.

If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.

## Ranger Conclave[]

At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave from the list of available conclaves. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

* Beast Conclave
* Deep Stalker Conclave
* Hunter Conclave

### Extra Attack[]

If you're playing a subclass introduced in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, you gain the Extra Attack feature at level 5 if your subclass doesn't have a different feature granted at level 5.

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Greater Favored Enemy[]

At 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

## Fleet of Foot[]

Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

## Hide in Plain Sight[]

Starting at 10th level, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes.

When you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.

If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.

## Vanish[]

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

## Feral Senses[]

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

## Foe Slayer[]

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Beast Conclave[]

### Animal Companion[]

At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.

At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.

If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.

#### Expanding Companion Options[]

Depending on the nature of your campaign, the DM might choose to expand the options for your animal companion. As a rule of thumb, a beast can serve as an animal companion if it is Medium or smaller, has 15 or fewer hit points, and cannot deal more than 8 damage with a single attack. In general, that applies to creatures with a challenge rating of 1/4 or less, but there are exceptions.

### Companion's Bond[]

Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

* The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.
* The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.
* When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.
* Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
* Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.
* For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
* Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
* Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.

Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."

| d6 | Personality Trait |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | I'm dauntless in the face of adversity. |
| 2 | Threaten my friends, threaten me. |
| 3 | I stay on alert so others can rest. |
| 4 | People see an animal and underestimate me. |
| 5 | I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time. |
| 6 | I put my friends' needs before my own in all things. |

| d6 | Flaw |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | If there's food left unattended, I'll eat it. |
| 2 | I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me. |
| 3 | Any time is a good time for a belly rub. |
| 4 | I'm deathly afraid of water. |
| 5 | My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face. |
| 6 | I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them. |

### Coordinated Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you and your animal companion form a more potent fighting force. When you use the Attack action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make a melee attack.

### Beast's Defense[]

At 7th level, while your companion can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws.

### Storm of Claw and Fangs[]

At 11th level, your companion can use its action to make a melee attack against each creature of its choice within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target.

### Superior Beast's Defense[]

At 15th level, whenever an attacker that your companion can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack's damage against it.

## Deep Stalker Conclave[]

### Underdark Scout[]

At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. On your first turn during combat, you gain a +10 bonus to your speed and if you use the attack action on that turn, you can make one additional attack. You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. Such creatures gain no benefit when attempting to detect you in dark and dim conditions. Additionally, when the DM determines if you can hide from a creature, that creature gains no benefit from its darkvision.

### Deep Stalker Magic[]

At 3rd level, you have darkvision out to a range of 90 feet. If you already have darkvision, you increase its range by 30 feet. You also gain access to additional spells at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 15th level. Once you gain a deep stalker spell, it counts as a ranger spell for you but doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

## Hunter Conclave[]

### Hunter's Prey[]

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horde Breaker.

* **Horde Breaker:** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

### Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.

### Multiattack[]

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Volley or Whirlwind Attack.

### Superior Hunter's Defense[]

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Evasion, Stand Against the Tide, or Uncanny Dodge.

* **Evasion:** You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
* **Stand Against the Tide:** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Favored Enemy[]

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy:  aberrations,  beasts,  celestials,  constructs,  dragons,  elementals,  fey,  fiends,  giants,  monstrosities,  oozes,  plants, or  undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of  humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

## Natural Explorer[]

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

## Fighting Style[]

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Mariner (Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures):** As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Close Quarters Shooter (Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!]):** You are trained in making ranged attack at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
* **Tunnel Fighter (Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!]):** You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.

### Combat Superiority[]

At 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

#### Maneuvers[]

You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are chosen from the list of maneuvers available to fighters with the Battle Master archetype. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn one additional maneuver of your choice at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Each time you learn a new maneuver, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice[]

You start with four superiority dice, which are d8s, and you expend one whenever you use a maneuver. You regain them all when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

#### Saving Throws[]

Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC:** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

### Maneuvers[]

The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

* **Commander's Strike:** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
* **Disarming Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
* **Distracting Strike:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.
* **Evasive Footwork:** When you move on your turn, you can expend a superiority die, adding the total to your AC until you stop moving.
* **Feinting Attack:** You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. Until the end of the turn, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
* **Goading Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has a disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
* **Lunging Attack:** When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
* **Maneuvering Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.
* **Menacing Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
* **Parry:** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
* **Precision Attack:** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
* **Pushing Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
* **Rally:** On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.
* **Riposte:** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
* **Sweeping Attack:** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.
* **Trip Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Ranger Archetype[]

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

* Beast Master
* Hunter

## Primeval Awareness[]

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Poultices[]

At 3rd level, you can create special herbal poultices that have healing power comparable to some potions. You can spend 1 hour gathering herbs and preparing herbal poultices using treated bandages to create a number of such poultices equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can carry a number of poultices at one time equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The poultices you create cannot be applied by anyone but you. After 24 hours, any poultices that you have not used lose their potency.

If you spend 1 minute applying one of your poultices to a wounded humanoid creature, thereby expending its use, that creature regains 1d6 hit points for every two ranger levels you have (rounded up).

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Land's Stride[]

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

## Natural Antivenom[]

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on saving throws against poison and have resistance to poison damage. Additionally, you can use one of your poultices to cure one poison effect on the creature you are applying it to, in addition to restoring hit points.

## Hide in Plain Sight[]

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

## Call Natural Allies[]

Starting at 13th level, when you are in an area of your favored terrain, you can call natural creatures from that terrain to fight on your behalf, using your attunement to the natural world to convince them to aid you. The DM chooses beasts appropriate to the terrain to come to your aid from among those that could hear you and that are within 1 mile of you, in one of the following groups:

* One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower
* Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower
* Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
* Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

These beasts approach you from their current location, and will fight alongside you, attacking any creatures that are hostile to you. They are friendly to you and your comrades, and you roll initiative for the called creatures as a group, which takes its own turns. The DM has the creatures' statistics.

After 1 hour, these beasts return to their previous location. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again in the same general area for 24 hours, since the same animals will not repeatedly heed your call.

## Vanish[]

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

## Relentless[]

Starting at 17th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

## Feral Senses[]

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

## Foe Slayer[]

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Beast Master[]

### Ranger's Companion[]

You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.

If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

Like any creature, the beast can spend hit dice during a short rest.

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.

### Exceptional Training[]

Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn. In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Bestial Fury[]

Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.

### Beastly Coordination[]

Beginning at 15th level, when an attacker that you can see hits your beast companion with an attack, you can call out a warning. If your beast companion can hear you, it can use its reaction to halve the attack's damage against it.

## Hunter[]

### Hunter's Prey[]

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horde Breaker.

* **Colossus Slayer:** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
* **Giant Killer:** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
* **Horde Breaker:** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

### Defensive Tactics[]

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Escape the Horde, Multiattack Defense, or Steel Will.

* **Escape the Horde:** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.
* **Multiattack Defense:** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.
* **Steel Will:** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Multiattack[]

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Volley or Whirlwind Attack.

* **Volley:** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.
* **Whirlwind Attack:** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

### Superior Hunter's Defense[]

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Evasion, Stand Against the Tide, or Uncanny Dodge.

* **Evasion:** You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
* **Stand Against the Tide:** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.
* **Uncanny Dodge:** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Optional Class Features[]

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers an additional feature that you can gain as a rogue. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the feature here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain the feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description.

#### Steady Aim[]

*3rd-level rogue feature*

As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Basic Features[]

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/5/59/Rogue.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/257?cb=20221208114743)

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per rogue level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per rogue level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords
* **Tools:** Thieves' tools
* **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence
* **Skills:** Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth.

### Equipment[]

* (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
* (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword
* (a) a burglar's pack, (b) a dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack
* Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background and start with 4d4 x 10 gp.

## Expertise[]

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

## Sneak Attack[]

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

## Thieves' Cant[]

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

## Cunning Action[]

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

## Roguish Archetype[]

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. Your archetype grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

* Arcane Trickster (Player's Handbook, page 97)
* Assassin (Player's Handbook, page 97)
* Inquisitive (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 45)
* Mastermind (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 46)
* Phantom (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 62)
* Scout (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 47)
* Soulknife (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 63)
* Swashbuckler (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 47; Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 135)
* Thief (Player's Handbook, page 97)

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Uncanny Dodge[]

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

## Evasion[]

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Reliable Talent[]

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

## Blindsense[]

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

## Slippery Mind[]

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

## Elusive[]

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

## Stroke of Luck[]

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Arcane Trickster[]

(Player's Handbook, page 97)

### Spellcasting[]

| Level | Cantrips | Spells | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd | 3 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — |
| 4th | 3 | 4 | 3 | — | — | — |
| 7th | 3 | 5 | 4 | 2 | — | — |
| 8th | 3 | 6 | 4 | 2 | — | — |
| 10th | 4 | 7 | 4 | 3 | — | — |
| 11th | 4 | 8 | 4 | 3 | — | — |
| 13th | 4 | 9 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — |
| 14th | 4 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — |
| 16th | 4 | 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | — |
| 19th | 4 | 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 20th | 4 | 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

#### Cantrips[]

You learn three cantrips: Mage Hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. At 10th level you learn another cantrip from the wizard spell list.

#### Spell Slots[]

The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You start with two 1st-level spell slots at Rogue level 3, and gain more as you gain more Rogue levels.

#### Spells Known[]

You know three 1st level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list. The third can be from any school of magic.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

#### Spellcasting Ability[]

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + proficiency bonus + Intelligence mod

**Spell attack mod** = proficiency bonus + Intelligence mod

### Mage Hand Legerdemain[]

Starting at 3rd level, when you cast Mage Hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

* You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
* You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
* You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.

### Magical Ambush[]

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.

### Versatile Trickster[]

At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your Mage Hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.

### Spell Thief[]

At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Assassin[]

(Player's Handbook, page 97)

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

### Assassinate[]

Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Infiltration Expertise[]

Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

### Impostor[]

At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerism.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike[]

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

## Inquisitive[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 45)

### Ear for Deceit[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you develop a talent for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

### Eye for Detail[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues.

### Insightful Fighting[]

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.

This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.

### Steady Eye[]

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

### Unerring Eye[]

Beginning at 13th level, your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Eye for Weakness[]

At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature's weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature increases by 3d6.

## Mastermind[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 46)

### Master of Intrigue[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.

Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.

### Master of Tactics[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.

### Insightful Manipulator[]

Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

* Intelligence score
* Wisdom score
* Charisma score
* Class levels (if any)

At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.

### Misdirection[]

Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.

### Soul of Deceit[]

Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

## Phantom[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 62)

### Whispers of the Dead[]

*3rd-level Phantom feature*

Echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain it, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature to choose a different proficiency that you lack.

### Wails from the Grave[]

*3rd-level Phantom feature*

As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can channel the power of death to harm someone else as well. Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the roll's total, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Tokens of the Departed[]

*9th-level Phantom feature*

When a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form; as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to generate it.

You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.
You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:

* While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object.
* When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of that feature.
* As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM.

### Ghost Walk[]

*13th-level Phantom feature*

You can phase partially into the realm of the dead, becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you assume a spectral form. While in this form, you have a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or object.

You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, you must finish a long rest or destroy one of your soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to activate Ghost Walk.

### Death's Friend[]

*17th level Phantom feature*

Your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:

* When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can deal the necrotic damage to both the first and second creature.
* At the end of the long rest, a soul trinket appears in your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.

## Scout[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 47)

### Skirmisher[]

Starting at 3rd level, you are difficult to pin down during a fight. You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Survivalist[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.

### Superior Mobility[]

At 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.

### Ambush Master[]

Starting at 13th level, you excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight.

You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.

### Sudden Strike[]

Starting at 17th level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.

## Soulknife[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 63)

### Psionic Power[]

*3rd-level Soulknife feature*

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.

***Psi-Bolstered Knack.*** When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.

***Psychic Whispers.*** You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others — perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.

The first time you use this power after each long rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

### Psychic Blades[]

*3rd-level Soulknife feature*

You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.

### Soul Blades[]

*9th-level Soulknife feature*

Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use your Psionic Energy dice:

***Homing Strikes.*** If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die.

***Psychic Teleportation.*** As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

### Psychic Veil[]

*13th-level Soulknife feature*

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to use this feature again.

### Rend Mind[]

*17th-level Soulknife feature*

You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target is stunned for 1 minute. The stunned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three Psionic Energy dice to use it again.

## Swashbuckler[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 47; Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 135)

### Fancy Footwork[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

### Rakish Audacity[]

Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

### Panache[]

At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.

If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

### Elegant Maneuver[]

Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

### Master Duelist[]

Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Thief[]

(Player's Handbook, page 97)

### Fast Hands[]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

### Second-Story Work[]

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

### Supreme Sneak[]

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

### Use Magic Device[]

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

### Thief's Reflexes[]

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

# Fighter, Ranger, Rogue[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Ranger, Rogue])

## The Revived[]

You've had a soul-shaking realization: you've been dead before, yet somehow you are alive again. This life isn't your first; it might not even be your second. Your past life, or lives, are unclear to you, but you know that you passed through the gates of death. And the powers of death, or some other influence, wasn't done with you. You might have convinced a deity to let you return to the Material Plane, perhaps you signed a deal with a fiend, or maybe you used an artifact that revived you.Whatever force brought you back, you now know the truth about yourself: that you are one of death's representatives among the living.

### Tokens of Past Lives[]

*3rd-level Revived feature*

You remember talents you had in your previous life. When you finish a long rest, you gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice. You can replace this proficiency with another when you finish a long rest.

### Revived Nature[]

*3rd-level Revived feature*

Your newfound connection to death gives you the following benefits:

* You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
* You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
* You don't need to sleep. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least four hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you remain semiconscious, and you can hear as normal.

### Bolts from the Grave[]

*3rd-level Revived feature*

You have learned to unleash bolts of necrotic energy from within your revived body. Immediately after you use your Cunning Action, you can make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you, provided you haven't used your Sneak Attack this turn. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. A creature hit by this attack takes necrotic damage equal to your Sneak Attack. This uses your Sneak Attack for the turn.

### Connect with the Dead[]

*9th-level Revived feature*

You can create a link with a spirit through their corpse. When you do so, you cast the Speak With Dead spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Speaking with the dead in this way temporarily gives you a capability from a past life — you're unsure whether it's from your past or the spirit's. When the spell ends, you gain one random benefit from the Revived Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Revived Capabilities[]

| d3 | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | You learn how to speak, read, and write one language of your choice. |
| 2 | You gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice. |
| 3 | You gain proficiency with one saving throw of your choice. |

After you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Audience with Death[]

*13th-level Revived feature*

When at death's door, you can converse with the powers of death. You have advantage on death saving throws, and whenever you make a death saving throw, your spirit can ask an entity of death a question that can be answered with "yes," "no," or "unknown." The entity answers truthfully, using the knowledge of all those who have died.

In addition, whenever you have 0 hit points and are healed or stabilized, you can change any of your personal characteristics: personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw.

### Ethereal Jaunt[]

*17th-level Revived feature*

Like a ghost, you have the ability to slip in and out of the Ethereal Plane. You can now use your Cunning Action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You don't need to see that space to teleport to it, but your teleportation fails, wasting your bonus action, if you attempt to teleport through magical force that is Medium or larger, such as a Wall of Force. If you appear in a space occupied by another creature or filled by an object, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are shunted.

# Sidekicks

From Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, pages 142-147.

This section provides a straightforward way to add a special NPC — called a sidekick — to the group of adventurers. These rules take a creature with a low challenge rating and give it levels in one of three simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.

A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them during the campaign. For examples, the characters might meet a villager, an animal, or another creature, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to join them on their adventures.

You can also use these rules to customize a monster for your own use as a DM.

## Creating a Sidekick[]

A sidekick can be any type of creature with a stat block in the Monster Manual or another D&D book, but the challenge rating in its stat block must be 1/2 or lower. You take that stat block and add to it, as explained in the "Gaining a Sidekick Class" section.

To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the friend of at least one of them. This friendship might be connected to a character's backstory, or to the events that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick could be a childhood friend or a pet, or it might be a creature the adventurers saved. As a DM, you determine whether there is sufficient trust established for the creature to join the group.

You decide who plays the sidekick. Here are some options:

* A player plays the sidekick as their second character — ideal when you only have one or two players.
* A player plays the sidekick as their only character — ideal for a player who wants a character who's simpler than a typical player character.
* The players jointly play the sidekick.
* You play the sidekick.

There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in a group, but having more than one per player character can noticeably slow down the game. And when estimating the difficulty of an upcoming encounter, count each sidekick as a character.

## Gaining a Sidekick Class[]

When you create a sidekick, you choose the class it will have for the rest of its career: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior, each of which is detailed below. If a sidekick class contains a choice, you may make the choice or let the players make it.

### Starting Level[]

The starting level of a sidekick is the same as the average level of the group. For example, if a 1st-level group starts out with a sidekick, that sidekick is also 1st level, but if a 10th-level group invites a sidekick to join them, that sidekick starts at 10th level.

### Leveling Up a Sidekick[]

Whenever a group's average level goes up, the sidekick gains a level. It doesn't matter how much of the group's recent adventures the sidekick experienced, the sidekick levels up because of a combination of the adventures it shared with the group and its own training.

### Hit Points[]

Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one hit die, and its hit point maximum increases. To determine the amount of the increase, roll the hit die (the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block), and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level.

If the sidekick drops to 0 hit points and isn't killed outright, it falls unconscious and subsequently makes death saving throws, just like a player character.

### Proficiency Bonus[]

The sidekick's proficiency bonus is determined by its level in its class, as shown in the class' table.

Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus increases by 1, add 1 to the hit modifier of all the attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its stat block by 1.

### Ability Score Increases[]

Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Improvement feature, adjust anything in its stat block that relies on an ability modifier that you increase. For example, if the sidekick has an attack that uses its Strength modifier, increase the attack's modifiers to hit and damage if the Strength modifier increases.

If it's unclear whether a melee attack in the stat block uses Strength or Dexterity, the attack can use either.

## Expert[]

The Expert is a master of certain tasks or knowledge, favoring cunning over brawn. It might be a scout, a musician, a librarian, a clever street kid, a wily merchant, or a burglar.

To gain the Expert class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it gains levels, as summarized on the Expert table.

### The Expert Table[]

| Level | Prof. Bonus | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | +2 | Bonus Proficiencies, Helpful |
| 2nd | +2 | Cunning Action |
| 3rd | +2 | Expertise |
| 4th | +2 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 5th | +3 | — |
| 6th | +3 | Coordinated Strike |
| 7th | +3 | Evasion |
| 8th | +3 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 9th | +4 | — |
| 10th | +4 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 11th | +4 | Inspiring Help (1d6) |
| 12th | +4 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 13th | +5 | — |
| 14th | +5 | Reliable Talent |
| 15th | +5 | Expertise |
| 16th | +5 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 17th | +6 | — |
| 18th | +6 | Sharp Mind |
| 19th | +6 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 20th | +6 | Inspiring Help (2d6) |

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

*1st-level Expert feature*

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Dexterity, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in five skills of your choice, and it gains proficiency with light armor. If it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency with all simple weapons and with two tools of your choice.

### Helpful[]

*1st-level Expert feature*

The sidekick is adept at giving well-timed assistance; the sidekick can take the Help action as a bonus action.

### Cunning Action[]

*2nd-level Expert feature*

The sidekick's agility or quick thinking allows it to act speedily. On its turn in combat, it can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action.

### Expertise[]

*3rd-level Expert feature*

Choose two of the sidekick's skill proficiencies. The sidekick's proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check it makes that uses any of the chosen proficiencies.

At 15th level, choose two more of the sidekick's skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement[]

*4th-level Expert feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Coordinated Strike[]

*6th-level Expert feature*

The sidekick is adept at fighting in concert with a companion. When the sidekick uses its Helpful feature to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target can be up to 30 feet away from the sidekick, and the sidekick can deal an extra 2d6 damage to it the next time the sidekick hits it with an attack roll before the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

### Evasion[]

*7th-level Expert feature*

Because of extraordinary good luck, the sidekick is skilled at avoiding danger. When the sidekick is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick doesn't benefit from this feature while incapacitated.

### Inspiring Help[]

*11th-level Expert feature*

When the sidekick takes the Help action, the creature who receives the help also gains a 1d6 bonus to the d20 roll. If that roll was an attack roll, the creature can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the attack's damage roll against one target.

At 20th level, the bonus increases to 2d6.

### Reliable Talent[]

*14th-level Expert feature*

The sidekick has refined its skills to an exceptional degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Sharp Mind[]

*18th-level Expert feature*

The sidekick gains proficiency in one of the following saving throws of your choice: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

## Spellcaster[]

A sidekick who becomes a Spellcaster walks the paths of magic. The sidekick might be a hedge wizard, a priest, a soothsayer, a magical performer, or a person with magic in their veins.

To gain the Spellcaster class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it gains levels, as summarized on the Spellcaster table.

### The Spellcaster Table[]

| Level | Prof. Bonus | Features | Cantrips Known | Spells Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 17th | +6 | — | 4 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 18th | +6 | Ability Score Improvement | 4 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 19th | +6 | — | 4 | 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| 20th | +6 | Focused Casting | 4 | 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

*1st-level Spellcaster feature*

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, Persuasion, and Religion.

The sidekick gains proficiency with light armor, and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency with all simple weapons.

### Spellcasting[]

*1st-level Spellcaster feature*

The sidekick gains the ability to cast spells. (If the creature already has the Spellcasting trait, this feature replaces that trait.) Choose the Spellcaster's role: Mage, Healer, or Prodigy. This choice determines the spell list and spellcasting ability used by the sidekick, as shown on the Spellcasting table.

| Class | Spell List | Ability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mage | Wizard | Intelligence |
| Healer | Cleric and Druid | Wisdom |
| Prodigy | Bard and Warlock | Charisma |

***Spell Slots.*** The Spellcaster table shows how many spell slots the sidekick has to cast its Spellcaster spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, the sidekick must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The sidekick regains all expended spell slots when it finishes a long rest.

***Spells Known.*** The sidekick knows two cantrips and one 1st-level spell of your choice from its spell list. Here are the recommendations for a 1st-level spellcaster of each role:

* **Mage:** Mage Hand, Ray of Frost, Thunderwave
* **Healer:** Cure Wounds, Guidance, Sacred Flame
* **Prodigy:** Eldritch Blast, Healing Word, Light

The Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the Spellcaster tables shows when the sidekick learns more spells of your choice. Each of the spells in the Spells Known column must be of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when the sidekick reaches 5th level in this class, it can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when the sidekick gains a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells it knows from this class and replace it with another spell from its spell list. The new spell must be a cantrip or of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** The sidekick's spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the choice you made on the Spellcasting table.

The sidekick uses its spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to that ability. In addition, it uses its spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell it casts and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + the sidekick's proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = sidekick's proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier

***Spellcasting Focus.*** The sidekick can use a focus for its spells depending on the choice you made on the Spellcasting table. A Mage can use an arcane focus, a Healer can use a holy symbol, and a Prodigy can use an arcane focus or a musical instrument.

### Ability Score Improvement[]

*4th-level Spellcaster feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Potent Cantrips[]

*6th-level Spellcaster feature*

The sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier to the damage it deals with any cantrip.

### Empowered Spells[]

*14th-level Spellcaster feature*

Choose one school of magic. Whenever the sidekick casts a spell of that school by expending a spell slot, the sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier to the spell's damage roll or healing roll, if any.

### Focused Casting[]

*20th-level Spellcaster feature*

Taking damage can't break the sidekick's concentration on a spell.

## Warrior[]

A Warrior sidekick grows in martial prowess as it fights by your side. It might be a soldier, a town guard, a battle-trained beast, or any other creature honed for combat.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the Warrior table.

### The Warrior Table[]

| Level | Prof. Bonus | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | +2 | Bonus Proficiencies, Martial Role |
| 2nd | +2 | Second Wind (1 use) |
| 3rd | +2 | Improved Critical |

| 18th | +6 | — |
| 19th | +6 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 20th | +6 | Second Wind (2 uses) |

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

*1st-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival.

The sidekick gains proficiency with all armor, and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it gains proficiency with shields and all simple and martial weapons.

### Martial Role[]

*1st-level Warrior feature*

Each warrior focuses on offense or defense in their training. Choose one of the following options:

* **Attacker.** The sidekick gains a +2 bonus to all attack rolls.
* **Defender.** The sidekick can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on an attack roll of a creature within 5 feet of it whose target isn't the sidekick, provided the sidekick can see the attacker.

### Second Wind[]

*2nd-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick can use a bonus action on its turn to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + its level in this class. Once it uses this feature, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.

The sidekick can use this feature twice between rests starting at 20th level.

### Improved Critical[]

*3rd-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick's attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

### Ability Score Improvement[]

*4th-level Warrior feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack[]

*6th-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when the sidekick reaches 15th level.

If the sidekick has the Multiattack action, it can use Extra Attack or Multiattack on a turn, not both.

### Battle Readiness[]

*7th-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick has advantage on initiative rolls.

### Improved Defense[]

*10th-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick's Armor Class increases by 1.

### Indomitable[]

*11th-level Warrior feature*

The sidekick can reroll a saving throw that it fails, but it must use the new roll. When it uses this feature, it can't use the feature again until it finishes a long rest.

The sidekick can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 18th level.

### Optional Class Features[]

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a sorcerer. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Metamagic Options[]

*3rd-level sorcerer feature*

When you choose Metamagic options, you have access to the following additional options.

***Seeking Spell.*** If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

***Transmuted Spell.*** When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.

#### Sorcerous Versatility[]

*4th-level sorcerer feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing the magic within you flowing in new ways:

* Replace one of the options you chose for the Metamagic feature with a different Metamagic option available to you.
* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the sorcerer spell list.

#### Magical Guidance[]

*5th-level sorcerer feature*

You can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try to conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per sorcerer level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per sorcerer level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** None
* **Weapons:** Darts, daggers, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows
* **Tools:** None

* (a) a Dungeoneer's pack or (b) an Explorer's pack
* Two daggers

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 3d4 x 10 gp.

## Spellcasting[]

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

### Cantrips[]

You know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 5th cantrip at 4th level and a 6th at 10th level.

### Spell Slots[]

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Burning Hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Burning Hands using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher[]

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

## Sorcerous Origin[]

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, from the list of available origins

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

* Aberrant Mind (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 66)
* Clockwork Soul (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 68)
* Divine Soul (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 50)

* Storm Sorcery (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 51)
* Wild Magic (Player's Handbook, page 103)

## Font of Magic[]

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

### Sorcery Points[]

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

### Flexible Casting[]

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

***Creating Spell Slots.*** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |

***Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.

## Metamagic[]

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Careful Spell[]

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

### Distant Spell[]

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

### Empowered Spell[]

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell[]

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

### Heightened Spell[]

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

### Quickened Spell[]

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

### Subtle Spell[]

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

### Twinned Spell[]

When you cast a spell that doesn't have a range of self and is incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray aren't eligible, but Ray of Frost and Chromatic Orb are.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Sorcerous Restoration[]

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.

## Aberrant Mind[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 66)

### Psionic Spells[]

*1st-level Aberrant Mind feature*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a divination or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Arms of Hadar, Dissonant Whispers, Mind Sliver |
| 3rd | Calm Emotions, Detect Thoughts |
| 5th | Hunger of Hadar, Sending |
| 7th | Evard's Black Tentacles, Summon Aberration |
| 9th | Rary's Telepathic Bond, Telekinesis |

### Telepathic Speech[]

*1st-level Aberrant Mind feature*

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if you are incapacitated or die or if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

### Psionic Sorcery[]

*6th-level Aberrant Mind feature*

When you cast any spell of 1st level or higher from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level.

If you cast the spell using sorcery points, it requires no verbal or somatic components, and it requires no material components, unless they are consumed by the spell.

### Psychic Defenses[]

*6th-level Aberrant Mind feature*

You gain resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

### Revelation in Flesh[]

*14th-level Aberrant Mind feature*

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for 10 minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:

* You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.
* You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or shines with an otherworldly light.
* You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. Moreover, gills grow from your neck or fan out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, or you grow writhing cilia that extend through your clothing.
* Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.

### Warping Implosion[]

*18th-level Aberrant Mind feature*

You can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

## Clockwork Soul[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 68)

### Clockwork Magic[]

*1st-level Clockwork Soul feature*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Alarm, Protection From Evil and Good |
| 3rd | Aid, Lesser Restoration |
| 5th | Dispel Magic, Protection From Energy |
| 7th | Freedom of Movement, Summon Construct |
| 9th | Greater Restoration, Wall of Force |

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your sorcerer spells.

| d6 | Manifestation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Spectral cogwheels hover behind you |
| 2 | The hands of a clock spin in your eyes |
| 3 | Your skin glows with a brassy sheen |
| 4 | Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body |
| 5 | Your spellcasting focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism |
| 6 | The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic |

### Restore Balance[]

*1st-level Clockwork Soul feature*

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Bastion of Law[]

*6th-level Clockwork Soul feature*

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this feature again.

The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

### Trance of Order[]

*14th-level Clockwork Soul feature*

You gain the ability to align your consciousness to the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

### Clockwork Cavalcade[]

*18th-level Clockwork Soul feature*

You summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the following effects within the cube before vanishing:

* The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the cube.
* Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are repaired instantly.
* Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the cube.

Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.

## Divine Soul[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 50)

### Divine Magic[]

Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

| Affinity | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| Good | Cure Wounds |
| Evil | Inflict Wounds |
| Law | Bless |
| Chaos | Bane |
| Neutrality | Protection From Evil and Good |

### Favored by the Gods[]

Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Empowered Healing[]

Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.

### Otherworldly Wings[]

Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.

### Unearthly Recovery[]

At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Draconic Bloodline[]

(Player's Handbook, page 102)

### Dragon Ancestor[]

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your Proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
| --- | --- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

### Draconic Resilience[]

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

### Elemental Affinity[]

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

### Dragon Wings[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

### Draconic Presence[]

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

## Pyromancer[]

(Plane Shift: Kaladesh, page 9)

### Heart of Fire[]

At 1st level, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, fiery magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level (minimum of 1).

### Fire in the Veins[]

At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. In addition, spells you cast ignore resistance to fire damage.

### Pyromancer's Fury[]

Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal fire damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level, and ignores resistance to fire damage.

### Fiery Soul[]

At 18th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to fire damage and treats immunity to fire damage as resistance to fire damage.

## Shadow Magic[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 50)

### Eyes of the Dark[]

Starting at 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the Darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.

### Strength of the Grave[]

Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Hound of Ill Omen[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf's statistics, with the following changes:

* The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
* It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
* It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
* At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.

The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.

### Shadow Walk[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.

### Umbral Form[]

Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

## Storm Sorcery[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 51)

### Wind Speaker[]

The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.

### Tempestuous Magic[]

Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Heart of the Storm[]

At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.

### Storm Guide[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you.

If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.

If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.

### Storm's Fury[]

Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

### Wind Soul[]

At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.

You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Wild Magic[]

(Player's Handbook, page 103)

### Wild Magic Surge[]

Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. A Wild Magic Surge can happen once per turn.

If a Wild Magic effect is a spell, it's too wild to be affected by Metamagic. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

### Tides of Chaos[]

Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

### Bend Luck[]

Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

### Controlled Chaos[]

At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

### Spell Bombardment[]

Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Spell Versatility[]

*1st-level sorcerer feature (enhances Spellcasting)*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

## Font of Magic Options[]

*2nd-level sorcerer feature (enhances Font of Magic)*

When you gain the Font of Magic feature, you get access to the following ways to spend your sorcery points.

### Empowering Reserves[]

When you make an ability check on your turn, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on the check.

### Imbuing Touch[]

As an action, you can touch one nonmagical weapon and spend 2 sorcery points to imbue it with magic for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

### Sorcerous Fortitude[]

As an action, you can spend any number of sorcery points to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

## Metamagic Options[]

*3rd-level sorcerer feature (enhances Metamagic)*

When you choose Metamagic options, you have access to the following additional options.

### Seeking Spell[]

When you cast a spell that requires you to make a spell attack roll or that forces a target to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 sorcery point to ignore the effects of half and three-quarters cover against targets of the spell.

# Giant Soul Sorcerer[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Giant Soul Sorcerer])

## Giant Soul[]

The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm. In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken. During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power. These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria. Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse. Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.

### Jotun Resilience[]

The resilience of giants flows through your body. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

### Mark of the Ordning[]

At 1st level, you discover innate magical abilities within yourself that are based on your giant heritage. Select one of the giant types from the Mark of the Ordning table. At 1st and 3rd level, you learn the spells associated with your choice, as shown in the table. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, but they don't count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

| Giant Type | Spells at 1st Level | Spells at 3rd Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Giant | Fog Cloud, Minor Illusion | Invisibility |
| Fire Giant | Burning Hands, Fire Bolt | Flaming Sphere |
| Frost Giant | Armor of Agathys, Ray of Frost | Hold Person |
| Hill Giant | Heroism, Shillelagh | Enlarge/Reduce |
| Stone Giant | Entangle, Resistance | Spike Growth |
| Storm Giant | Shocking Grasp, Thunderwave | Gust of Wind |

### Soul of Lost Ostoria[]

Starting at 6th level, you gain a benefit whenever you cast one of the spells granted by your Mark of the Ordning Feature.

* **Cloud Giant:** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you can magically teleport as a bonus action. You teleport to an unoccupied space you can see that is no farther away than a number of feet equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier.
* **Fire Giant:** You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your Mark of the Ordning spells. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).
* **Frost Giant:** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). But if the spell is Armor of Agathys, you instead increase its temporary hit points by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
* **Hill Giant:** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you can target up to two creatures within 5 feet of you that you can see. Each target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed a number of feet away from you equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1). A target can choose to fail this save.
* **Stone Giant:** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, you gain a bonus to AC equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) until the end of your next turn.
* **Storm Giant:** Immediately after you cast any of your Mark of the Ordning spells, up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you take lightning damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

### Rage of Fallen Ostoria[]

Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form. When you start casting a sorcerer spell on your turn and expend a spell slot, you can increase your size by one category — from Medium to Large, for example.

This increase lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you die or are incapacitated. Until it ends, you enjoy the following benefits:

* Your current hit points and your hit point maximum both increase by 1 per sorcerer level.
* Your reach increases by 5 feet.
* Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks; the bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Blessing of the All Father[]

At 18th level, your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

In addition, you can now use Rage of Fallen Ostoria twice between rests, but no more than once on a turn. If you use that feature while under its effects, its increases to your size, hit points, reach, and walking speed are cumulative.

# Heroes of Krynn[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Heroes of Krynn])

## Lunar Magic[]

On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world's three moons. On the world of Toril, the god Selûne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world's twelve moons.

You, or someone from your lineage, has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells. Consult the Manifestations of Lunar Magic table, then choose or randomly determine how your connection to the moon manifests while you cast your sorcerer spells.

### Manifestations of Lunar Magic[]

| d4 | Manifestation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | You glow with faint light that matches the color of a moon from your world. |
| 2 | Your pupils shift in shape, matching the current phase of a moon from your world. |
| 3 | Spectral manifestations of the moon (or moons) of your world orbit you. |
| 4 | Your shadow is limned in faint light, as if it were a lunar body during a solar eclipse. |

### Moon Fire[]

*1st-Level Lunar Magic Feature*

You can call down the radiant light of the moon on command. You learn the Sacred Flame spell, which doesn't count against the number of sorcerer cantrips you know. When you cast the spell, you can target one creature as normal or target two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other.

### Lunar Embodiment[]

*1st-Level Lunar Magic Feature*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lunar Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose what lunar phase manifests its power through your magic: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon. While in the chosen phase, spells of the associated phase in the Lunar Spells table can be cast once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Lunar Spells[]

| Sorcerer Level | Full Moon Spells | New Moon Spells | Crescent Moon Spells |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | Faerie Fire | Dissonant Whispers | Sanctuary |
| 3rd | Moonbeam | Darkness | Blindness/Deafness |
| 5th | Death Ward | Bestow Curse | Phantom Steed |
| 7th | Freedom of Movement | Evard's Black Tentacles | Hallucinatory Terrain |
| 9th | Mass Cure Wounds | Mislead | Dream |

*A note from the Wiki Staff: Death Ward is listed intentionally, as that is how it was in the document. We are aware it's not a 3rd-level spell.*

### Lunar Boons[]

*6th-Level Lunar Magic Feature*

Lunar phases influence your metamagic. Each lunar phase is associated with spells of the following schools of magic:

**Full Moon.** Abjuration and conjuration spells

**New Moon.** Evocation and necromancy spells

**Crescent Moon.** Divination and transmutation spells

Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell from the Lunar Spells table or a spell of a school of magic associated with the lunar phase you are in, you can reduce the sorcery points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the sorcery points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Waxing and Waning[]

*6th-Level Lunar Magic Feature*

You gain greater control over the phases of your lunar magic. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change your lunar phase for a different one.

### Lunar Empowerment[]

*14th-Level Lunar Magic Feature*

The power of a lunar phase saturates your being. Whenever you choose a lunar phase to affect your magic, you also gain the following benefit associated with that phase:

**Full Moon:** You shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, you and creatures of your choice have advantage on saving throws while within the bright light you shed.

**New Moon:** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, while you are in dim light or darkness, attack rolls have disadvantage against you.

**Crescent Moon:** You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

### Lunar Phenomenon[]

*18th-Level Lunar Magic feature*

Your lunar phase magic bursts. As a bonus action, you can tap into a special power of the lunar phase you are currently in. Alternatively, as part of the bonus action you take to change your lunar phase using your Waxing and Waning feature, you can immediately use the power of the lunar phase you are entering:

**Full Moon:** You radiate intense moonlight for a moment. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn. In addition, one creature of your choice in that area regains 3d8 hit points.

**New Moon:** You momentarily emanate an oppressive gloom. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you become invisible until the end of your next turn, or until you make an attack or cast a spell.

**Crescent Moon:** You slip through light and darkness. You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. In addition, you also gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

Once you use a phase's bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

# Mages of Strixhaven[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven])

## Using These Subclasses[]

Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass's entry.

### Choosing the Subclass[]

When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard's Bardic College, a wizard's Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character's class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.

How the subclass manifests in your character's story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer's innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron's usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.

### At Higher Levels[]

Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character's class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as "Level 6+," your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you're a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.

When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History's Whims feature, but not both.

## Mage of Prismari[]

Mages of Prismari use surges of elemental energy to express who they are and how they see the world. To them, magic and motion are one and the same; both are exhibitions of raw creativity through which masterpieces are made. In their pursuit of the arts, some Prismari mages focus on perfecting the fine details of their technique, while others prefer to unleash their wild creative visions in dazzling spectacles of elemental power.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Prismari subclass, you gain two features: Creative Skills and Kinetic Artistry.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Prismari counts as your circle; if you're a sorcerer, the magic of the college is the origin of your sorcery; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Creative Skills[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, or Performance.

### Kinetic Artistry[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You can Dash as a bonus action. When you take this bonus action, choose one of the following additional effects:

**Boreal Sweep.** Icy water swirls around you. Until the end of your turn, you can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless solid ground. Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.

**Scorching Whirl.** Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier.

**Thunderlight Jaunt.** You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

You can use a bonus action in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Favored Medium[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You have honed your forms of elemental expression to best suit your ideas. Choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. You gain resistance to that damage type.

Additionally, when you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals the chosen damage type, you emit a spectacular aura of artistry, which extends 5 feet from you in every direction (but not through total cover) and lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, each creature of your choice has resistance to your chosen damage type while within the aura, as you shape your favored elemental medium around them.

You can change your choice of damage type whenever you finish a long rest.

### Focused Expression[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Honing your talents, you skillfully infuse your motions with even more potent expressions of elemental might. Once per turn when you deal damage to at least one target, you gain an additional effect determined by the damage type chosen for your Favored Medium feature:

**Cold.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 cold damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, as ice mires it. A target can be affected by the ice only once per round.

**Fire.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 fire damage. Fortifying flames then dance around one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature gains 1d6 temporary hit points.

**Lightning.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 lightning damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn, as residual lightning shocks its form.

### Impeccable Physicality[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Your relentless dedication and training have instilled an outstanding sense of precision and grace in your art. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if you do not already have it. Additionally, when you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can treat a d20 roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.

## Mage of Quandrix[]

For those who become Mages of Quandrix, math and magic go hand-in-hand. Such individuals learn to break down natural phenomena into their core numerical components and, through manipulating those, alter reality on a whim. Their talents range from tangible physics, like multiplying plant growth and redistributing elements of probability and acceleration, to bizarrely theoretical exercises that warp the fundamentals of space and self.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Quandrix subclass, you gain two features: Quandrix Spells and Functions of Probability.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a sorcerer, the magic of Quandrix is part of your sorcerous origin, and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Quandrix Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

You learn the cantrip Guidance and the 1st-level spell Guiding Bolt. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Quandrix Spells table.

Each of these spells counts as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a wizard, you can add these spells to your spellbook upon learning them, without expending any gold, and prepare them as normal.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Enlarge/Reduce, Spike Growth |
| 5th | Aura of Vitality, Haste |
| 7th | Control Water, Freedom of Movement |
| 9th | Circle of Power, Passwall |

### Functions of Probability[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

By iterating on the mathematical patterns of reality, you can nudge chance to tilt around a creature. When you cast a spell using a spell slot that targets at least one creature, you can choose that creature or another creature within 30 feet of it (including yourself) and add one of the following effects:

**Diminishing Function.** The chosen creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or the creature must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.

**Supplemental Function.** Once before the start of your next turn, the chosen creature can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to an attack roll or a saving throw of its choice. The creature can roll the d6 after rolling the d20 but must decide before any effects of the roll occur.

### Velocity Shift[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

You learn to manipulate kinetic formulas and alter the velocity of another creature. When a creature you can see starts its turn or moves to a space within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail. On a failure, the creature is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.

You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Null Equation[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

Through careful calculations, you beset your enemies with abstract equations that reduce their might. Once per turn, immediately after dealing damage to a creature, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and its weapon attacks deal only half damage. These effects last until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Quantum Tunneling[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

Your mathematical expertise extends to altering the foundational equations of your very being. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Additionally, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you move while inside another creature or object. If you end your turn inside a creature or an object, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.

# Sorcerer[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Sorcerer])

## Phoenix Sorcery[]

Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix's power dwells within you.

That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can't bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.

More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.

Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.

| d6 | Phoenix Soul Quirk |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | You absentmindedly ignite small fires that quickly sputter out. |
| 2 | You cackle like a fiend when you unleash your fire spells. |
| 3 | You admire fire, even if it burns your friends. |
| 4 | You are covered in burns that mark the first time your power manifested. |
| 5 | You like your food charred. |
| 6 | You are brave to the point of recklessness. |

### Ignite[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to start fires with a touch. As an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand — an object such as a torch, a piece of tinder, or the hem of drapes.

### Mantle of Flame[]

Starting at 1st level, you can unleash the phoenix fire that blazes within you.

As a bonus action, you magically wreathe yourself in swirling fire, as your eyes glow like hot coals. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

* You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
* Any creature takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier if it hits you with a melee attack from within 5 feet of you or if it touches you.
* Whenever you roll fire damage on your turn, the roll gains a bonus to equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Phoenix Spark[]

Starting at 6th level, the fiery energy within you grows restless and vengeful. In the face of defeat, it surges outward to preserve you in a fiery roar. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the spark of the phoenix. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier.

If you use this feature while under the effects of your Mantle of Flame, this feature instead deals fire damage equal to your sorcerer level + double your Charisma modifier, and your Mantle of Flame immediately ends.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Nourishing Fire[]

Starting at 14th level, your fire spells soothe and restore you. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that includes a fire damage roll, you regain hit points equal to the slot's level + your Charisma modifier.

### Form of the Phoenix[]

At 18th level, you finally master the spark of fire that dances within you. While under the effect of your Mantle of Flame feature, you gain additional benefits:

* You have a flying speed of 40 feet and can hover.
* You have resistance to all damage.
* If you use your Phoenix Spark, that feature deals an extra 20 fire damage to each creature.

## Sea Sorcery[]

The power of water is the strength of flexibility, resilience, and a relentless nature. Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a mountain reaches the sea. It might bend and turn across valleys and down hillsides, but it slowly and steadily returns to the waves. Those whose souls are touched by the power of elemental water command a similar power.

Your heritage ties to powerful creatures of the sea, such as nereids, the lords of the merfolk, and elemental powers. Like a river, you feel the call of the ocean. The call is ever present in your heart, and you are never completely at peace until you are near the sea.

### Soul of the Sea[]

At 1st level, your tie to the sea grants you the ability to breathe underwater, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed.

### Curse of the Sea[]

When you choose this origin at 1st level, you learn the secret of infusing your spells with a watery curse. When you hit a creature with a cantrip's attack or when a creature fails a saving throw against your cantrip, you can curse the target until the end of your next turn or until you curse a different creature with this feature.

Once per turn when you cast a spell, you can trigger the curse if that spell deals cold or lightning damage to the cursed target or forces it to move. Doing so subjects the target to the appropriate additional effect below, and then the curse ends if the spell isn't a cantrip (you choose the effect to use if more than one effect applies):

* **Cold Damage.** If the affected target takes cold damage from your spell, the target's speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target's speed, use whichever reduction is greater.
* **Lightning Damage.** If the affected target takes lightning damage from your spell, the target takes additional lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
* **Forced Movement.** If the target is moved by your spell, increase the distance it is moved by 15 feet.

### Watery Defense[]

At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage.

You also gain the ability to defend yourself by momentarily assuming a watery form. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack and take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from it, you can reduce that damage by an amount equal to your sorcerer level plus your Charisma score, and then you can move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this special reaction, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Shifting Form[]

Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to enter a liquid state while moving.

When you move on your turn, you take only half damage from opportunity attacks, and you can move through any enemy's space but can't willingly end your move there.

On your turn, you can move through any space that is at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing. When you stop moving, the regular squeezing rules apply if you're in a space one size smaller than you. You can't willingly stop in a space smaller than that, and if you're forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space that can fit you, back along the path of your movement.

### Water Soul[]

Starting at 18th level, your being is altered by the power of the sea. You gain the following benefits:

* You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep.
* A critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Stone Sorcery[]

Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth is yours to command.

Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

### Metal Magic[]

Your affinity for metal gives you the option to learn some non-sorcerer spells that focus on weapon attacks. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can select the spell from the following list of spells, in addition to the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

| Spell Level | Spells at 1st Level |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Compelled Duel, Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, Wrathful Smite |
| 2nd | Branding Smite, Magic Weapon |
| 3rd | Blinding Smite, Elemental Weapon |
| 4th | Staggering Smite |

### Stone's Durability[]

At 1st level, your connection to stone gives you extra fortitude. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

As an action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Constitution modifier if you aren't wearing armor, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield.

### Stone Aegis[]

Starting at 6th level, your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies' protection.

As a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your sorcerer level divided by 4. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.

In addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. You can teleport only if you and the attacker are on the same surface. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.

### Stone's Edge[]

Starting at 14th level, your mastery of earth magic allows you to add the force of elemental earth to your spells. When you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra force damage equal to half your sorcerer level. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.

### Earth Master's Aegis[]

Beginning at 18th level, when you use your Stone Aegis to protect an ally, you can choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.

### Optional Class Features[]

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a warlock. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section, if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Pact Boon Option[]

*3rd-level warlock feature*

When you choose your Pact Boon feature, the following option is available to you.

***Pact of the Talisman.*** Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

#### Eldritch Versatility[]

*4th-level warlock feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.
* Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.
* If you're 12 level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per warlock level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per warlock level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion

### Equipment[]

* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
* (a) a Scholar's pack or (b) a Dungeoneer's pack
* Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 4d4 x 10 gp.

## Pact Magic[]

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

### Cantrips[]

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.

### Spell Slots[]

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher[]

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

## Otherworldly Patron[]

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being chosen from the list of available patrons. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

* The Undying (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 139)

## Eldritch Invocations[]

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to warlock level, not character level.

## Pact Boon[]

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

### Pact of the Blade[]

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Pact of the Chain[]

You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.

### Pact of the Tome[]

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Mystic Arcanum[]

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch Master[]

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## The Archfey[]

(Player's Handbook, page 108)

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Faerie Fire, Sleep |
| 2nd | Calm Emotions, Phantasmal Force |
| 3rd | Blink, Plant Growth |
| 4th | Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility |
| 5th | Dominate Person, Seeming |

### Fey Presence[]

Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Misty Escape[]

Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Beguiling Defenses[]

Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

### Dark Delirium[]

Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

## The Celestial[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 54)

### Expanded Spell List[]

| 2nd | Flaming Sphere, Lesser Restoration |
| 3rd | Daylight, Revivify |
| 4th | Guardian of Faith, Wall of Fire |
| 5th | Flame Strike, Greater Restoration |

### Bonus Cantrips[]

At 1st level, you learn the Sacred Flame and Light cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don't count against your number of cantrips known.

### Healing Light[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.

As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Radiant Soul[]

Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.

### Celestial Resilience[]

Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.

### Searing Vengeance[]

Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## The Fathomless[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 72)

### Expanded Spell List[]

You can magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle.

When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d8.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack.

You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Gift of the Sea[]

*1st-level Fathomless feature*

You gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can breathe underwater.

### Oceanic Soul[]

*6th-level Fathomless feature*

You are now even more at home in the depths. You gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when you are fully submerged, any creature that is also fully submerged can understand your speech, and you can understand theirs.

### Guardian Coil[]

*6th-level Fathomless feature*

Your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and others, interposing itself between them and harm. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage to that creature by 1d8. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage reduced by the tentacle increases to 2d8.

### Grasping Tentacles[]

*10th-level Fathomless feature*

You learn the spell Evard's Black Tentacles. It counts as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. Moreover, damage can't break your concentration on this spell.

### Fathomless Plunge[]

*14th-level Fathomless feature*

You can magically open temporary conduits to watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport yourself and up to five other willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the others.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## The Fiend[]

(Player's Handbook, page 109)

### Dark One's Own Luck[]

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Fiendish Resilience[]

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

### Hurl Through Hell[]

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## The Genie[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 73)

### Expanded Spell List[]

*1st-level Genie feature*

| 9th | Wish | — | — | — | — |

### Genie's Vessel[]

*1st-level Genie feature*

Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a measure of the genie's power. The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie's Vessel table.

| d6 | Vessel |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Oil lamp |
| 2 | Urn |
| 3 | Ring with a compartment |
| 4 | Stoppered bottle |
| 5 | Hollow statuette |
| 6 | Ornate lantern |

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:

**Bottled Respite.** As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is comfortably appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.

**Genie's Wrath.** Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

### Elemental Gift[]

*6th-level Genie feature*

You begin to take on characteristics of your patron's kind. You now have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

In addition, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Sanctuary Vessel[]

*10th-level Genie feature*

When you enter your Genie's Vessel via the Bottled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel with you.

As a bonus action, you can eject any number of creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if you leave or the vessel is destroyed.

In addition, anyone (including you) who remains within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points they regain if they spend any hit dice as part of a short rest there.

### Limited Wish[]

*14th-level Genie feature*

You entreat your patron to grant you a small wish. As an action, you can speak your desire to your Genie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action. The spell can be from any class's spell list, and you don't need to meet the requirements in that spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect as part of this action.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

## The Great Old One[]

(Player's Handbook, page 109)

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| 2nd | Detect Thoughts, Phantasmal Force |
| 3rd | Clairvoyance, Sending |
| 4th | Dominate Beast, Evard's Black Tentacles |
| 5th | Dominate Person, Telekinesis |

### Awakened Mind[]

Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Entropic Ward[]

At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Thought Shield[]

Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.

### Create Thrall[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a Remove Curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.

## The Hexblade[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 55)

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| 2nd | Blur, Branding Smite |
| 3rd | Blink, Elemental Weapon |
| 4th | Phantasmal Killer, Staggering Smite |
| 5th | Banishing Smite, Cone of Cold |

### Hexblade's Curse[]

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
* Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
* If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Hex Warrior[]

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

### Accursed Specter[]

Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Armor of Hexes[]

At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

### Master of Hexes[]

Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.

## The Undead[]

(Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, page 30)

### Expanded Spell List[]

*1st-level Undead feature*

### Form of Dread[]

You manifest an aspect of your patron's dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed:

* You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.
* Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
* You are immune to the frightened condition.

You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your body might glow with gylphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds, suggesting your mummy patron.

### Grave Touched[]

*6th-level Undead feature*

Your patron's powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.

In addition, once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack roll and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.

### Mortal Husk[]

*10th-level Undead feature*

Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic damage.

In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and cause your body to erupt with deathly energy. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level. You then gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

### Spirit Projection[]

*14th-level Undead feature*

Your spirit can become unteathered from your physical form. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation.

Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit's space (your choice).

While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:

* Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn't require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.
* You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
* While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## The Undying[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 139)

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | False Life, Ray of Sickness |
| 2nd | Blindness/Deafness, Silence |
| 3rd | Feign Death, Speak With Dead |
| 4th | Aura of Life, Death Ward |
| 5th | Contagion, Legend Lore |

### Among the Dead[]

Starting at 1st level, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease.

Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of Fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.

### Defy Death[]

Starting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Undying Nature[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.

In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

### Indestructible Life[]

When you reach 14th level, you partake some of the true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Eldritch Invocations List[]

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you. The teleportation can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

### Book of Ancient Secrets[]

(Player's Handbook, page 110)

***Prerequisite:** Pact of the Tome*

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list. The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

### Chains of Carceri[]

(Player's Handbook, page 110)

***Prerequisite:** 15th level, Pact of the Chain*

You can cast Hold Monster at will — targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental — without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

### Cloak of Flies[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 56)

***Prerequisite:** 5th level*

As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you're incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The aura grants you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.

You can cast the Sending spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.

### Fiendish Vigor[]

(Player's Handbook, page 111)

You can cast False Life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.

### Gaze of Two Minds[]

(Player's Handbook, page 111)

You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

### Ghostly Gaze[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 56)

***Prerequisite:** 7th level*

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you don't already have it.

### Gift of the Depths[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 57)

***Prerequisite:** 5th level*

### Gift of the Protectors[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 71)

***Prerequisite:** 9th-level warlock, Pact of the Tome feature*

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.

* The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Spell Versatility[]

*1st-level warlock feature (enhances Pact Magic)*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Pact Magic feature with another spell from the warlock spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

## Eldritch Invocation Options[]

*2nd-level warlock feature (enhances Eldritch Invocations)*

When you choose eldritch invocations, you have access to the following options.

### Eldritch Armor[]

*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

As an action, you can touch a suit of armor that isn't being worn or carried by anyone and instantly don it, provided you aren't wearing armor already. You are proficient with this suit of armor until it's removed.

# Revised Class Options[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options])

## Warlock: Eldritch Invocations[]

At 2nd level, a warlock gains the Eldritch Invocations feature. Here are new options for that feature, in addition to those in the Player's Handbook.

If an eldritch invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn the invocation. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisite. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class

### Kiss of Mephistopheles[]

*Prerequisite: 5th level, Eldritch Blast cantrip*

When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast, you can cast Fireball as a bonus action using a warlock spell slot. However, the spell must be centered on a creature you hit with Eldritch Blast.

# Modern Magic[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic])

## The Ghost in the Machine[]

You have made a bargain for power granted by an entity that you believe to be completely digital. Whether it is a rogue AI or the spirit of a deceased hacker, the Ghost in the Machine is capable of feats that defy explanation.

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Ghost in the Machine lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. You gain the On/Off cantrip, and the following new spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Infallible Relay, Remote Access |
| 2nd | Arcane Hacking, Digital Phantom |
| 3rd | Haywire, Invisibility to Cameras |
| 4th | Conjure Knowbot, System Backdoor |
| 5th | Shutdown, Synchronicity |

### Bonus Proficiency[]

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools.

### Information Surge[]

At 1st level, you gain the ability to temporarily render computerized devices inoperable. As an action, you can target a computerized device within 30 feet of you. If the targeted device is held or otherwise actively used by a living creature, that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the targeted device ceases to function until the end of your next turn. If the targeted device is not held or used by a creature, the DM makes a special saving throw for the device with disadvantage and a +0 modifier. Certain shielded devices might negate the disadvantage, at the DM's determination.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Wire Walk[]

Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to travel short distances over electrical wires, data lines, or telephone cables. As a bonus action, you can touch a device or socket connected to a hardwired network and teleport along this network to another device or socket within your line of sight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Personal Encryption[]

Beginning at 10th level, you have learned to apply your innate knowledge of encryption to your thoughts, memories, and presence. You have advantage on saving throws against scrying, thought detection, or any other method of magically learning your whereabouts or reading your thoughts. For any such effect that does not grant you a saving throw but which requires the creature targeting you to make an ability check, the check is made with disadvantage.

### Technovirus[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's body with living circuitry. You can use an action to make a melee attack against a humanoid creature using your spell attack modifier. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC as a techno-organic virus quickly spreads through its body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, you can use an action to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the Command spell. The target makes its saving throw against your command with disadvantage. You can issue this command at any time while the target remains infected.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, at which point the target is cured of the technovirus. The infection can also be removed with a lesser restoration spell.

## Additional Invocation[]

Warlocks who favor modern weapons can learn to channel their magic through those weapons.

### Arcane Gunslinger[]

*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

You can create a pact weapon that is a sidearm or long arm, and you can transform a magical sidearm or long arm into your pact weapon.

# Mages of Strixhaven[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven])

## Using These Subclasses[]

Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass's entry.

### Choosing the Subclass[]

When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard's Bardic College, a wizard's Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character's class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.

How the subclass manifests in your character's story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer's innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron's usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.

### At Higher Levels[]

Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character's class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as "Level 6+," your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you're a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.

When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History's Whims feature, but not both.

## Mage of Lorehold[]

Mages of Lorehold are particularly concerned with the forces that underlie and drive history. Drawing inspiration from the scholars and adventurers of old, they manifest the arcane power of the past through ethereal dioramas and fantastical battle prowess. Lorehold mages are often found with a long-dead spirit summoned at their side — for who better to learn ancient history from than one who has experienced it first-hand?

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Lorehold subclass, you gain two features: Lorehold Spells and Ancient Companion.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a bard, the College of Lorehold counts as your college; if you're a warlock, the magic of the college serves as your patron; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Lorehold Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

You learn the cantrip Sacred Flame and the 1st-level spell Comprehend Languages. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lorehold Spells table.

Each of these spells counts as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a wizard, you can add these spells to your spellbook upon learning them, without expending any gold, and prepare them as normal.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Knock, Locate Object |
| 5th | Speak With Dead, Spirit Guardians |
| 7th | Arcane Eye, Stone Shape |
| 9th | Destructive Wave, Legend Lore |

### Ancient Companion[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

You learn to call on the spirits of the ancient dead and house them temporarily in the remnants of old statues, so they may remain longer on this plane to bolster your studies and aid you in battle.

Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a Medium, freestanding statue within 10 feet of you to serve as your ancient companion. See this creature's game statistics in the Ancient Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you bond with your ancient companion, choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines certain traits in its stat block. The statue determines the spirit's appearance.

The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.

The companion perishes when it drops to 0 hit points, when you bond with a new ancient companion at the end of a short or long rest, or when you die. When the companion perishes, the spirit within returns to its plane of origin, and the statue becomes an inert object.

### Lessons of the Past[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

Through your studies, you learn how to better listen and take to heart the teachings of history. When you bond with your ancient companion, you gain the following additional benefits depending on the type of spirit you chose:

**Healer.** Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level in this class, and you gain the same number of hit points. When you regain hit points from a spell, you regain an additional 1d8 hit points.

**Sage.** You have advantage on ability checks using the Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion skills. Additionally, once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can deal an additional 1d8 force damage to that creature.

**Warrior.** If you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as part of that action. If that weapon attack hits, the target takes an additional 1d8 radiant damage.

When you bond with a new ancient companion of a different type, you immediately lose the benefits of your previous companion and gain the benefits from the new companion's type.

### War Echoes[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

By pulling from the magic of the past, you can cause your opponent's old wounds to resonate anew. Once per turn, when a creature you can see hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target becomes vulnerable to one of the damage types dealt by the attack. This vulnerability lasts until the end of the target's next turn and affects the damage dealt by the triggering attack.

You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### History's Whims[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

Through steeping yourself in the chaotic whims of history, you learn how to briefly channel the wild nature of time itself. As a bonus action, you can enter a state of chronal chaos. When you enter this state, and at the start of each of your subsequent turns while in this state, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

**Luck.** You receive brief flashes of the future, steeling yourself against oncoming assaults. Whenever you make a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, you can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Resistance.** You rewind time, knitting together injuries as they occur. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

**Swiftness.** Time stutters, slowing others but hurtling you forward. Your movement speed increases by 15 feet, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks.

The benefit lasts until the start of your next turn. You cannot choose the same benefit two rounds in a row.

The state lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to use it again.

## Mage of Silverquill[]

Mages of Silverquill hone the power of words. They channel the magic of light and shadow through words, whether spoken aloud, written, or signed through gestures. The words of a mage of Silverquill bring salvation to their allies and despair to their enemies.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Silverquill subclass, you gain two features: Eloquent Apprentice and Silvery Barbs.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a bard, the College of Silverquill counts as your college, if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron, and if you're a wizard, the college counts as your tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Eloquent Apprentice[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You learn one cantrip of your choice, either Sacred Flame or Vicious Mockery. It doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know, and it is added to your class spell list if it isn't there already.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in your choice of two of the following skills: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, or Insight.

### Silvery Barbs[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You can invoke words laced with magic to demoralize your foes and turn their misfortune into a boon to bolster your allies. Immediately after a creature you can see within 60 feet of you succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to demoralize the creature. Unless the creature is immune to being charmed, it rerolls the d20 and must use the lower roll. If the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw then fails, you can choose a different creature you can see within 60 feet of you (you can choose yourself). That creature is empowered, and can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute and use the higher result. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this feature at a time.

Once a creature fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of a reroll forced by this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.

### Inky Shroud[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You learn the Darkness spell, and it is added to your class spell list if it isn't there already. If you are a wizard, you add it to your spellbook, if it's not there already.

You can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, and you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell in this way, you can see normally through the darkness created, and when a creature you can see starts its turn in the darkness, you can deal 2d10 psychic damage to that creature.

You can also cast the spell normally, without the additional effects, by using spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

### Infusion of Eloquence[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can invoke additional words of power to change the spell's damage type to your choice of psychic or radiant. Any creature damaged by the spell takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus and has its emotions swayed with despair or adoration, based on the damage type dealt:

**Psychic.** The creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

**Radiant.** The creature is charmed by you until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Word of Power[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You can invoke a word of power that is the pinnacle of your magical study. You gain the following options:

**Deadly Despair.** When the target of your Silvery Barbs fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of the reroll, you can invoke a word of despair to give the target vulnerability to one damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn.

**Selfless Invocation.** When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can invoke a word of power using your reaction to grant the creature resistance to that damage, and you take an amount of psychic damage equal to the damage that creature takes.

## Mage of Witherbloom[]

Mages of Witherbloom draw their magic from the energy that endlessly flows from life to death, and back again. They see the duality of thriving life and inevitable death in all things, tapping and manipulating the transition of energy between these states. Some Witherbloom adherents focus on vital energies to nurture life and empower others, while others embrace the drain of vitality into decay to sap and strike down their foes.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Witherbloom subclass, you gain two features: Witherbloom Spells and Essence Tap.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Witherbloom counts as your circle, and if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Witherbloom Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You learn the cantrip Spare the Dying and the 1st-level spells Cure Wounds and Inflict Wounds. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Witherbloom Spells table.

Each of these spells count as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a druid, you always have the spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Lesser Restoration, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5th | Revivify, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Blight, Greater Restoration |
| 9th | Antilife Shell, Mass Cure Wounds |

### Essence Tap[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

As a bonus action, you can draw on a reservoir of life essence to empower yourself for 1 minute, or until you use this feature again. For the duration, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

**Overgrowth.** When you choose this benefit, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while the benefit lasts, you can expend and roll one Hit Die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Withering Strike.** When you deal damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic, and you ignore resistance to necrotic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Witherbloom Brew[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You gain proficiency with herbalism kits if you don't already have it.

When you finish a long rest, you can use an herbalism kit and a pot or cauldron to create magical brews. You create a number of brews equal to your proficiency bonus. Each brew requires its own flask. A brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. For each brew, choose one of the following effects:

**Fortifying.** When you create this brew, choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or radiant. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient gains resistance to the chosen damage type for 1 hour.

**Quickening.** A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 2d6 hit points, and one disease or condition from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user's choice): charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.

**Toxifying.** As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The next time the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature within 1 hour, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute.

### Witherbloom Adept[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

Your connection to the flow of life force deepens. Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage or restore hit points using a spell, one target of the spell takes additional damage or regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Withering Vortex[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

When you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals necrotic damage to any number of creatures that aren't Undead or Constructs, choose one of the creatures that took damage. You drain an amount of life energy equal to half the damage dealt to the chosen creature. One creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the life energy drained.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Warlock & Wizard[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Warlock & Wizard])

## The Raven Queen[]

Your patron is the Raven Queen, a mysterious being who rules the Shadowfell from a palace of ice deep within that dread realm. The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature's death and ensuring that it meets its end at the prescribed time and place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.

The Raven Queen's followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other intimations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Raven Queen lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | False Life, Sanctuary |
| 2nd | Silence, Spiritual Weapon |
| 3rd | Feign Death, Speak With Dead |
| 4th | Ice Storm, Locate Creature |
| 5th | Commune, Cone of Cold |

### Sentinel Raven[]

Starting at 1st level, you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you.

While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Perception score and to Perception checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can't be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can't take damage; and it is incapacitated.

You can see through the raven's eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.

The raven doesn't require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.

At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you — no matter where it is or whether it died — and it reappears within 5 feet of you.

### Soul of the Raven[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven's form. While merged, you become Tiny, you replace your speed with the raven's, and you can use your action only to dash, disengage, dodge, help, hide, or search. During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. As an action, you and the raven return to normal.

### Raven's Shield[]

At 10th level, the Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing. You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the frightened condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.

### Queen's Right Hand[]

Starting at 14th level, you can channel the Raven Queen's power to slay a creature. You can cast Finger of Death. After you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch Invocations[]

At 2nd level, a warlock gains the Eldritch Invocations feature. Here are new play test options for that feature.

Many of these new invocations are tied to a patron, allowing you to strengthen the bond between your warlock and an otherworldly patron.

Two of the invocations are associated with the Seeker, a patron that appeared in another installment of Unearthed Arcana.

### Burning Hex[]

*Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron*

As a bonus action, you cause a target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse to take fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

### Caiphon's Beacon[]

*Prerequisite: The Great Old One patron*

The purple star Caiphon is the doom of inexperienced mariners. Those who use its deceptive light to guide their travels invariably come to ruin. You gain proficiency in the Deception and Stealth skills, and you have advantage on attack rolls against charmed creatures.

### Chilling Hex[]

*Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron*

As a bonus action, you cause frost to swirl around a target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse, dealing cold damage to each of your enemies within 5 feet of the target. The cold damage equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

### Claw of Acamar[]

*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature, The Great Old One patron*

You can create a black, lead flail using your Pact of the Blade feature. The flail's head is sculpted to resemble a pair of grasping tentacles. The weapon has the reach property. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 necrotic damage to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature's speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.

### Chronicle of the Raven Queen[]

*Prerequisite: Raven Queen patron, Pact of the Tome feature*

You can place a corpse's hand or similar appendage on your Book of Shadows and ask one question aloud. After 1 minute, the answer appears written in blood in your book. The answer is provided by the dead creature's spirit to the best of its knowledge and is translated into a language of your choice. You must use this ability within 1 minute of a creature's death, and a given creature can only be asked one question in this manner.

### Curse Bringer[]

*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature, The Hexblade patron*

You can create a greatsword forged from silver, with black runes etched into its blade, using your Pact of the Blade feature. If you reduce a target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse to 0 hit points with this sword, you can immediately change the target of the curse to a different creature. This change doesn't extend the curse's duration.

When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 slashing damage to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature's speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.

### Moon Bow[]

*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature, The Archfey patron*

You can create a longbow using your Pact of the Blade feature. When you draw back its string and fire, it creates an arrow of white wood, which vanishes after 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against lycanthropes with the bow. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 radiant damage to the target per spell level.

### Path of the Seeker[]

*Prerequisite: The Seeker patron*

The Seeker bids you to travel in search of knowledge, and little can prevent you from walking this path. You ignore difficult terrain, have advantage on all checks to escape a grapple, manacles, or rope bindings, and advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed.

### Raven Queen's Blessing[]

*Prerequisite: The Raven Queen patron, Eldritch Blast cantrip*

When you score a critical hit with your Eldritch Blast cantrip, pick yourself or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature can immediately expend a hit die to regain hit points equal to the roll + the creature's Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

### Seeker's Speech[]

*Prerequisite: The Seeker patron*

When you complete a long rest, you can pick two languages. You gain the ability to speak, read, and write the chosen languages until you finish your next long rest.

### Superior Pact Weapon[]

*Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Blade feature*

Any weapon you create using your Pact of the Blade feature is a +2 weapon. This invocation doesn't affect a magic weapon you transformed into your pact weapon.

### Ultimate Pact Weapon[]

*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Blade feature*

Any weapon you create using your Pact of the Blade feature is a +3 weapon. This invocation doesn't affect a magic weapon you transformed into your pact weapon.

# The Faithful[]

( Unearthed Arcana: The Faithful])

## The Seeker[]

Your patron is an inscrutable being who travels the Astral Plane in search of knowledge and secrets. In return for your patron's gifts, you wander the world seeking lore that you can share with the Seeker.

Your patron could be any deity or other powerful entity dedicated to knowledge or forgotten lore. Celestian is an ideal patron for a Greyhawk campaign, and was the inspiration for this concept. In the Forgotten Realms, your patron might be Azuth or Oghma. Aureon makes an excellent patron in Eberron, while in Krynn and the Dragonlance campaign setting, Gilean is a good match for the Seeker's role.

### Expanded Spell List[]

The Seeker lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Feather Fall, Jump |
| 2nd | Levitate, Locate Object |
| 3rd | Clairvoyance, Sending |
| 4th | Arcane Eye, Locate Creature |
| 5th | Legend Lore, Passwall |

### Shielding Aurora[]

Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the Seeker's power to protect you from harm. As a bonus action, you create a whirling aurora of brilliant energy that swirls around you. Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage, and if a hostile creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, it takes radiant damage equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Pact Boon: Pact of the Star Chain[]

At 3rd level, a character dedicated to the Seeker can select this option instead of one of the warlock's existing Pact Boon options.

The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While the chain is on your person, you know the Augury spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker's power to gain advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from the Seeker. The ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous chain. The chain disappears in a flash of light when you die.

The exact form of this item might be different depending on your patron. The Star Chain is inspired by the Greyhawk deity Celestian.

### Astral Refuge[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to step into an astral refuge. As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Astral Plane, taking advantage of its timeless nature. While in your astral refuge, you can take two actions to cast spells that target only you. After using those two actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.

### Far Wanderer[]

At 10th level, you no longer need to breathe, and you gain resistance to fire damage and cold damage.

### Astral Sequestration[]

Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to sequester yourself and your allies on the Astral Plane.

By performing a special ritual over the course of 5 minutes, you shift yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see to the Astral Plane. You and those creatures gain the benefits of a short rest while sequestered on the Astral Plane. You then return to the spaces you all occupied when you used this ability, with no time having passed in the world.

During this short rest, you and the creatures you sequester can make use of any options available during a rest that affect only you and the creatures you sequester.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Optional Class Features[]

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a wizard. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement printed in the feature description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

### Cantrip Formulas[]

*3rd-level wizard feature*

You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult these formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.

## Basic Features[]

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/c/c7/Wizard.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/233?cb=20221129100014)

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per wizard level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per wizard level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** None
* **Weapons:** Darts, daggers, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
* **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion

### Equipment[]

* (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
* (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
* (a) a Scholar's pack or (b) an Explorer's pack
* A spellbook

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 4d4 x 10 gp.

## Arcane Recovery[]

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

## Spellcasting[]

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

### Cantrips[]

You know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 4th cantrip at 4th level and a 5th at 10th level.

### Spellbook[]

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.

* **Copying a Spell into the Book:** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

:   Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
:   For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
:   A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

* **Replacing the Book:** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

:   If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

* **The Book's Appearance:** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher[]

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

## Arcane Tradition[]

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition from the list of available traditions, shaping your practice of magic. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Spell Mastery[]

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

## Signature Spells[]

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Bladesinging[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 76; Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 141)

### Training in War and Song[]

*2nd-level Bladesinging feature*

You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it.

### Bladesong[]

*2nd-level Bladesinging feature*

You can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a single weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
* Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
* You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
* You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Extra Attack[]

*6th-level Bladesinging feature*

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### Song of Defense[]

*10th-level Bladesinging feature*

You can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the spell slot's level.

### Song of Victory[]

*14th-level Bladesinging feature*

You add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks while your Bladesong is active.

## Chronurgy Magic[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 184)

**This subclass is designed for Wildemount settings.** Check with your DM before using it in other settings.

### Dunamancy Spells[]

Chronurgy Magic lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a wizard spell. The following spells are added to the wizard spell list for you.

| Wizard Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Sapping Sting, Gift of Alacrity |
| 3rd | Fortune's Favor, Wristpocket |
| 5th | Pulse Wave |
| 9th | Temporal Shunt |
| 13th | Tether Essence |
| 15th | Reality Break |
| 17th | Time Ravage |

### Chronal Shift[]

At 2nd level, you can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.

You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Temporal Awareness[]

At 2nd level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.

### Momentary Stasis[]

At 6th level, as an action, you can magically force a Large or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the saving throw is a success, the creature is encased in a field of magical energy until the end of your next turn or until the creature takes any damage. While encased in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Abeyance[]

At 10th level, when you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can condense the spell's magic into a mote. The spell is frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 1 hour. This bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is destroyed, it vanishes in a flash of light, and the spell is lost.

A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the creature who released it as the caster for all other purposes.

Once you create a bead with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Convergent Future[]

At 14th level, you can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them into events around you, ensuring a particular outcome. When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to ignore the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed to succeed or one less than that number (your choice).

When you use this feature, you gain one level of exhaustion. Only by finishing a long rest can you remove a level of exhaustion gained in this way.

## Graviturgy Magic[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 185)

**This subclass is designed for Wildemount settings.** Check with your DM before using it in other settings.

### Dunamancy Spells[]

Graviturgy Magic lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a wizard spell. The following spells are added to the wizard spell list for you.

| Wizard Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Sapping Sting, Magnify Gravity |
| 3rd | Fortune's Favor, Immovable Object, Wristpocket |
| 5th | Pulse Wave |
| 7th | Gravity Sinkhole |
| 11th | Gravity Fissure |
| 13th | Tether Essence |
| 15th | Dark Star |
| 17th | Ravenous Void |

### Adjust Density[]

At 2nd level, as an action, you can magically alter the weight of one object or creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The object or creature must be Large or smaller. The target's weight is halved or doubled for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump twice as far as normal, and it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller.

### Gravity Well[]

At 6th level, you've learned how to manipulate gravity around a living being: whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.

### Violent Attraction[]

At 10th level, when another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase the attack's velocity, causing the attack's target to take an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type.

Alternatively, if a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to increase the fall's damage by 2d10.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Event Horizon[]

At 14th level, as an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.

## Order of Scribes[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 77)

### Wizardly Quill[]

*2nd-level Order of the Scribes feature*

As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:

* The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
* The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
* You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.

### Awakened Spellbook[]

*2nd-level Order of the Scribes feature*

Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.

While you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:

* You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
* When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
* When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.

### Manifest Mind[]

*6th-level Order of Scribes feature*

You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).

While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).

Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.

The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts Dispel Magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.

Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.

### Master Scrivener[]

*10th-level Order of Scribes feature*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.

The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.

You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.

### One with the Word[]

*14th-level Order of the Scribes feature*

Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.

Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.

Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook.

Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## School of Abjuration[]

(Player's Handbook, page 115)

### Abjuration Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Arcane Ward[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Ward[]

Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### Improved Abjuration[]

Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in Counterspell and Dispel Magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

### Spell Resistance[]

Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

## School of Conjuration[]

(Player's Handbook, page 116)

### Conjuration Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Minor Conjuration[]

Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.

The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, if it takes any damage, or if it deals any damage.

### Benign Transposition[]

Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.

### Focused Conjuration[]

Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

### Durable Summons[]

Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.

## School of Divination[]

(Player's Handbook, page 116)

### Divination Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Portent[]

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Expert Divination[]

Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.

### The Third Eye[]

Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a rest.

* **Darkvision:** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
* **Ethereal Sight:** You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.
* **Greater Comprehension:** You can read any language.
* **See Invisibility:** You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.

### Greater Portent[]

Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.

## School of Enchantment[]

(Player's Handbook, page 117)

### Enchantment Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Hypnotic Gaze[]

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

### Instinctive Charm[]

Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.

You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.

### Split Enchantment[]

Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

### Alter Memories[]

At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.

Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

## School of Evocation[]

(Player's Handbook, page 117)

### Evocation Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Sculpt Spells[]

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip[]

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

### Overchannel[]

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th-level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

## School of Illusion[]

(Player's Handbook, page 118)

### Illusion Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Improved Minor Illusion[]

When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the Minor Illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

### Malleable Illusions[]

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.

### Illusory Self[]

Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Illusory Reality[]

By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

## School of Necromancy[]

(Player's Handbook, page 118)

### Necromancy Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Grim Harvest[]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

### Undead Thralls[]

At 6th level, you add the Animate Dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast animate dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:

* The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.
* The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

### Inured to Undeath[]

Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

### Command Undead[]

Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

## School of Transmutation[]

(Player's Handbook, page 119)

### Transmutation Savant[]

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Minor Alchemy[]

Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

### Transmuter's Stone[]

Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:

* Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
* An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered
* Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
* Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)

Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.

### Shapechanger[]

At 10th level, you add the Polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

Once you cast Polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

### Master Transmuter[]

Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.

* **Major Transformation:** You can transmute one nonmagical object — no larger than a 5 — foot cube into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.
* **Panacea:** You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
* **Restore Life:** You cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.
* **Restore Youth:** You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.

## War Magic[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 59)

### Arcane Deflection[]

At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

When you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.

### Tactical Wit[]

Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

### Power Surge[]

Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with dispel magic or counterspell, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.

### Durable Magic[]

Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.

### Deflecting Shroud[]

At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your wizard level.

# Giant Options[]

(Unearthed Arcana 2022: Giant Options])

## Runecrafter[]

Runecrafter wizards enhance their spellcasting through the ancient power of runes. Though the tradition originated with the giant rune casters of old, runecraft magic has expanded to encompass countless languages and practitioners across different worlds.

For many runecrafters, the runes they wield are as every bit unique and personal as their spellbook. Some strive to honor the practice’s origins among the giants, engraving their runes on decorative stones that adorn their spellcasting implements, while others messily scribble their runes on scraps of paper.

### Runes of Understanding[]

At 2nd level, your study of runecraft has unlocked the ability to decode runes and languages, regardless of their origin; you always have Comprehend Languages prepared, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, and the spell doesn’t count against the number of spells you have prepared.

### Runic Empowerment[]

When you choose this subclass at 2nd level, you learn how to amplify your magic through the application of various runes. Your knowledge of these runes is stored in your spellbook, though you determine the runes’ cosmetic appearance. For example, your runes could be engraved into the cover of your spellbook, glowing whenever you cast a spell, or you could work the shape and meaning of the runes directly into a spell’s somatic and verbal components.

When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you can invoke one of the following runes:

* **Life Rune.** When you invoke this rune, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot expended.

* **War Rune.** When you invoke this rune, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, attack rolls that target the chosen creature gain a bonus equal to half the level of the spell slot expended (rounded up, minimum of +1).

* **Wind Rune.** When you invoke this rune, your speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot expended, and your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. These benefits last until the start of your next turn.

You can invoke no more than one rune per spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Sigils of Warding[]

Starting at 6th level, you can call on a rune of protection to guard yourself against threats. When you fail a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Runic Empowerment and succeed on the saving throw instead.

### Rune Maven[]

At 10th level, your understanding of runecraft has grown immensely. Whenever you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you also regain a number of your expended uses of Runic Empowerment. The number of uses you regain can be no more than half your Intelligence modifier, rounded up (minimum of 1).

### Engraved Enmity[]

At 14th level, you have mastered the art of wielding your runes directly against your foes. As a bonus action, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be magically marked by an enmity rune.

The enmity rune appears as a faintly glowing mote of energy that hovers over the marked creature, which suffers the following effects:

**Runecraft’s Bane.** The creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells you cast.

**Unveiled Enemy.** The radiance of the glowing rune makes the creature visible if it’s invisible, and the creature can’t become invisible while the rune persists.

**Woeful Curse.** When you mark the creature, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can invoke the enmity rune to curse the creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack roll, the target also takes 1d8 force damage, and the curse ends.

The enmity rune lasts for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). Once you have marked a creature in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again.

# Eberron[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Eberron])

## Artificer[]

Artificers are a key part of the world of Eberron. They illustrate the evolution of magic from a wild, unpredictable force to one that is becoming available to the masses. Magic items are part of everyday life in the Five Nations of Khorvaire; with an artificer in your party, they become part of every adventuring expedition.

The artificer was a separate class in prior editions of the Eberron setting, a melee combatant who specialized in mystically enhanced arms and armor. The fifth edition rules treat the artificer as a new wizard tradition that focuses on mystical invention, which you can choose starting at 2nd level.

### Infuse Potions[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can produce magic potions. You spend 10 minutes focusing your magic on a vial of mundane water and expend a spell slot to transform it into a potion. Once you have expended a spell slot to create a potion, you cannot regain that slot until the potion is consumed or after 1 week, at which time the potion loses its effectiveness. You can create up to three potions at a time; creating a fourth potion causes the oldest currently active one to immediately lose its potency. If that potion has been consumed, its effects immediately end.

The spell slot you expend determines the type of potion you can create.

| Spell Slot | Potion Created |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Climbing, growth, or healing |
| 2nd | Mind reading or greater healing |
| 3rd | Invisibility, superior healing, or water breathing |
| 4th | Resistance |

### Infuse Scrolls[]

At 2nd level, you can also tap into your reserves of magical energy to create spell scrolls. You can use your Arcane Recovery ability to create a scroll instead of regaining expended spell slots.

You must finish a short rest, then spend 10 minutes with parchment, quill, and ink to create a spell scroll containing one spell chosen from those you know. Subtract the spell's level from the total levels worth of slots you regain using Arcane Recovery. This reduction to your Arcane Recovery applies until you use the scroll and then finish a long rest.

### Infuse Weapons and Armor[]

Beginning at 6th level, you can produce magic weapons and armor. You spend 10 minutes focusing your magic on a mundane weapon, suit of armor, shield, or bundle of twenty pieces of ammunition, and expend a spell slot to infuse it with magical energy. The magic item retains its enhancement for 8 hours or until used (in the case of magic ammunition). You can infuse only one item at a time; if you infuse a second one, the first immediately loses its potency. Once you have expended a spell slot to create such an item, you cannot regain that slot until the item becomes nonmagical.

The spell slot you expend determines the type of weapon, armor, or shield you can create.

| Spell Slot | Item Created |
| --- | --- |
| 2nd | +1 ammunition (20 pieces) |
| 3rd | +1 weapon or +1 shield |
| 4th | +1 armor |
| 5th | +2 weapon or +2ammunition (20 pieces) |
| 6th | +2 armor |

### Superior Artificer[]

Starting at 10th level, you can create a second magic weapon, suit of armor, shield, or bundle of ammunition using your Infuse Weapons and Armor ability. Attempting to infuse a third item causes the oldest one to immediately lose its potency.

You can also create one additional potion or scroll using Infuse Potions or Infuse Scrolls.

### Master Artificer[]

On reaching 14th level, your mastery of arcane magic allows you to produce a variety of magic items. You can create a single item chosen from Magic Item Tables A and B. It takes you 1 week to produce such an item, and you must rest for 1 month before using this ability to craft another item.

# Warlock and Wizard[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard])

## Lore Mastery[]

Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure.

Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic.Other savants are generous teachers, countering ignorance and deception with deep knowledge and good humor.

### Lore Master[]

Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics.Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill if you are proficient in that skill.

In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).

### Spell Secrets[]

At 2nd level, you master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies.

When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list(you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). You replace one energy type for another by altering the spell's formula as you cast it.

When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Altering Spells.*** While the Spell Secrets feature offers increased versatility, at the table its effects can be difficult to spot by the other players. If you're playing a savant, take a moment to describe how you alter your spells. Think of a signature change your character is particularly proud of. Be inventive, and make the game more fun for everyone by playing up the sudden, unexpected tricks you character can employ. For example, a Fireball transformed to require a Strength save might become a sphere of burning rock that shatters and slams into its target. A Charm Person that requires a Constitution save might take the form of a vaporous narcotic that alters the target's mood.

### Alchemical Casting[]

At 6th level, you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.

An additional **1st-level spell slot** can increase the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.

An additional **2nd-level spell slot** can increase the spell's range. If the spell's range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile.

An additional **3rd-level spell slot** can increase the spell's potency. Increase the spell's save DC by 2.

### Prodigious Memory[]

At 10th level, you have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. As a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Master of Magic[]

At 14th level, your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell. As a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any class's spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn't have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn't a wizard spell, it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when you cast it or when the current turn ends.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

# Mages of Strixhaven[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven])

## Using These Subclasses[]

Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass's entry.

### Choosing the Subclass[]

When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard's Bardic College, a wizard's Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character's class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.

How the subclass manifests in your character's story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer's innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron's usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.

### At Higher Levels[]

Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character's class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as "Level 6+," your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you're a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.

When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History's Whims feature, but not both.

## Mage of Lorehold[]

Mages of Lorehold are particularly concerned with the forces that underlie and drive history. Drawing inspiration from the scholars and adventurers of old, they manifest the arcane power of the past through ethereal dioramas and fantastical battle prowess. Lorehold mages are often found with a long-dead spirit summoned at their side — for who better to learn ancient history from than one who has experienced it first-hand?

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Lorehold subclass, you gain two features: Lorehold Spells and Ancient Companion.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a bard, the College of Lorehold counts as your college; if you're a warlock, the magic of the college serves as your patron; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Lorehold Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

You learn the cantrip Sacred Flame and the 1st-level spell Comprehend Languages. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lorehold Spells table.

Each of these spells counts as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a wizard, you can add these spells to your spellbook upon learning them, without expending any gold, and prepare them as normal.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Knock, Locate Object |
| 5th | Speak With Dead, Spirit Guardians |
| 7th | Arcane Eye, Stone Shape |
| 9th | Destructive Wave, Legend Lore |

### Ancient Companion[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

You learn to call on the spirits of the ancient dead and house them temporarily in the remnants of old statues, so they may remain longer on this plane to bolster your studies and aid you in battle.

Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a Medium, freestanding statue within 10 feet of you to serve as your ancient companion. See this creature's game statistics in the Ancient Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you bond with your ancient companion, choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines certain traits in its stat block. The statue determines the spirit's appearance.

The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.

The companion perishes when it drops to 0 hit points, when you bond with a new ancient companion at the end of a short or long rest, or when you die. When the companion perishes, the spirit within returns to its plane of origin, and the statue becomes an inert object.

### Lessons of the Past[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

Through your studies, you learn how to better listen and take to heart the teachings of history. When you bond with your ancient companion, you gain the following additional benefits depending on the type of spirit you chose:

**Healer.** Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level in this class, and you gain the same number of hit points. When you regain hit points from a spell, you regain an additional 1d8 hit points.

**Sage.** You have advantage on ability checks using the Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion skills. Additionally, once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can deal an additional 1d8 force damage to that creature.

**Warrior.** If you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as part of that action. If that weapon attack hits, the target takes an additional 1d8 radiant damage.

When you bond with a new ancient companion of a different type, you immediately lose the benefits of your previous companion and gain the benefits from the new companion's type.

### War Echoes[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

By pulling from the magic of the past, you can cause your opponent's old wounds to resonate anew. Once per turn, when a creature you can see hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target becomes vulnerable to one of the damage types dealt by the attack. This vulnerability lasts until the end of the target's next turn and affects the damage dealt by the triggering attack.

You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### History's Whims[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Lorehold Feature*

Through steeping yourself in the chaotic whims of history, you learn how to briefly channel the wild nature of time itself. As a bonus action, you can enter a state of chronal chaos. When you enter this state, and at the start of each of your subsequent turns while in this state, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

**Luck.** You receive brief flashes of the future, steeling yourself against oncoming assaults. Whenever you make a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, you can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Resistance.** You rewind time, knitting together injuries as they occur. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

**Swiftness.** Time stutters, slowing others but hurtling you forward. Your movement speed increases by 15 feet, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks.

The benefit lasts until the start of your next turn. You cannot choose the same benefit two rounds in a row.

The state lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to use it again.

## Mage of Prismari[]

Mages of Prismari use surges of elemental energy to express who they are and how they see the world. To them, magic and motion are one and the same; both are exhibitions of raw creativity through which masterpieces are made. In their pursuit of the arts, some Prismari mages focus on perfecting the fine details of their technique, while others prefer to unleash their wild creative visions in dazzling spectacles of elemental power.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Prismari subclass, you gain two features: Creative Skills and Kinetic Artistry.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Prismari counts as your circle; if you're a sorcerer, the magic of the college is the origin of your sorcery; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Creative Skills[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, or Performance.

### Kinetic Artistry[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You can Dash as a bonus action. When you take this bonus action, choose one of the following additional effects:

**Boreal Sweep.** Icy water swirls around you. Until the end of your turn, you can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless solid ground. Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.

**Scorching Whirl.** Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier.

**Thunderlight Jaunt.** You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

You can use a bonus action in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Favored Medium[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You have honed your forms of elemental expression to best suit your ideas. Choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. You gain resistance to that damage type.

Additionally, when you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals the chosen damage type, you emit a spectacular aura of artistry, which extends 5 feet from you in every direction (but not through total cover) and lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, each creature of your choice has resistance to your chosen damage type while within the aura, as you shape your favored elemental medium around them.

You can change your choice of damage type whenever you finish a long rest.

### Focused Expression[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Honing your talents, you skillfully infuse your motions with even more potent expressions of elemental might. Once per turn when you deal damage to at least one target, you gain an additional effect determined by the damage type chosen for your Favored Medium feature:

**Cold.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 cold damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, as ice mires it. A target can be affected by the ice only once per round.

**Fire.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 fire damage. Fortifying flames then dance around one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature gains 1d6 temporary hit points.

**Lightning.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 lightning damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn, as residual lightning shocks its form.

### Impeccable Physicality[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Your relentless dedication and training have instilled an outstanding sense of precision and grace in your art. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if you do not already have it. Additionally, when you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can treat a d20 roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.

## Mage of Quandrix[]

For those who become Mages of Quandrix, math and magic go hand-in-hand. Such individuals learn to break down natural phenomena into their core numerical components and, through manipulating those, alter reality on a whim. Their talents range from tangible physics, like multiplying plant growth and redistributing elements of probability and acceleration, to bizarrely theoretical exercises that warp the fundamentals of space and self.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Quandrix subclass, you gain two features: Quandrix Spells and Functions of Probability.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a sorcerer, the magic of Quandrix is part of your sorcerous origin, and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Quandrix Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

You learn the cantrip Guidance and the 1st-level spell Guiding Bolt. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Quandrix Spells table.

Each of these spells counts as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a wizard, you can add these spells to your spellbook upon learning them, without expending any gold, and prepare them as normal.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Enlarge/Reduce, Spike Growth |
| 5th | Aura of Vitality, Haste |
| 7th | Control Water, Freedom of Movement |
| 9th | Circle of Power, Passwall |

### Functions of Probability[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

By iterating on the mathematical patterns of reality, you can nudge chance to tilt around a creature. When you cast a spell using a spell slot that targets at least one creature, you can choose that creature or another creature within 30 feet of it (including yourself) and add one of the following effects:

**Diminishing Function.** The chosen creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or the creature must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.

**Supplemental Function.** Once before the start of your next turn, the chosen creature can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to an attack roll or a saving throw of its choice. The creature can roll the d6 after rolling the d20 but must decide before any effects of the roll occur.

### Velocity Shift[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

You learn to manipulate kinetic formulas and alter the velocity of another creature. When a creature you can see starts its turn or moves to a space within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail. On a failure, the creature is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.

You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Null Equation[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

Through careful calculations, you beset your enemies with abstract equations that reduce their might. Once per turn, immediately after dealing damage to a creature, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and its weapon attacks deal only half damage. These effects last until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Quantum Tunneling[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Quandrix Feature*

Your mathematical expertise extends to altering the foundational equations of your very being. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Additionally, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you move while inside another creature or object. If you end your turn inside a creature or an object, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.

## Mage of Silverquill[]

Mages of Silverquill hone the power of words. They channel the magic of light and shadow through words, whether spoken aloud, written, or signed through gestures. The words of a mage of Silverquill bring salvation to their allies and despair to their enemies.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Silverquill subclass, you gain two features: Eloquent Apprentice and Silvery Barbs.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a bard, the College of Silverquill counts as your college, if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron, and if you're a wizard, the college counts as your tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Eloquent Apprentice[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You learn one cantrip of your choice, either Sacred Flame or Vicious Mockery. It doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know, and it is added to your class spell list if it isn't there already.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in your choice of two of the following skills: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, or Insight.

### Silvery Barbs[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You can invoke words laced with magic to demoralize your foes and turn their misfortune into a boon to bolster your allies. Immediately after a creature you can see within 60 feet of you succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to demoralize the creature. Unless the creature is immune to being charmed, it rerolls the d20 and must use the lower roll. If the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw then fails, you can choose a different creature you can see within 60 feet of you (you can choose yourself). That creature is empowered, and can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute and use the higher result. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this feature at a time.

Once a creature fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of a reroll forced by this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.

### Inky Shroud[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You learn the Darkness spell, and it is added to your class spell list if it isn't there already. If you are a wizard, you add it to your spellbook, if it's not there already.

You can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, and you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell in this way, you can see normally through the darkness created, and when a creature you can see starts its turn in the darkness, you can deal 2d10 psychic damage to that creature.

You can also cast the spell normally, without the additional effects, by using spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

### Infusion of Eloquence[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can invoke additional words of power to change the spell's damage type to your choice of psychic or radiant. Any creature damaged by the spell takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus and has its emotions swayed with despair or adoration, based on the damage type dealt:

**Psychic.** The creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

**Radiant.** The creature is charmed by you until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Word of Power[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Silverquill Feature*

You can invoke a word of power that is the pinnacle of your magical study. You gain the following options:

**Deadly Despair.** When the target of your Silvery Barbs fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of the reroll, you can invoke a word of despair to give the target vulnerability to one damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn.

**Selfless Invocation.** When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can invoke a word of power using your reaction to grant the creature resistance to that damage, and you take an amount of psychic damage equal to the damage that creature takes.

# Cleric, Druid, and Wizard[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Cleric, Druid, and Wizard])

## Onomancy[]

Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical significance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it.

That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target's true name, the wizard's spells slip between the cracks of the target's defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms.

***True Names.*** Onomancy, or naming magic, is a method of spellcasting that uses a creature's true name to enhance a spell's effects. A true name is the name by which a self-aware creature identifies itself. This name might be the name a person was given at birth, or one a person chose or earned later in life. Whatever a name's origin, the simplest way for you to know your true name is to think truthfully about yourself and then think, "My name is..." Your true name is how you finish that sentence.

You can try to hide your true name by using a pseudonym, but you must be wary not to inhabit that false name too deeply. If a false name comes to be the best expression of who you are, it becomes your true name. Changing one's true name is never a quick choice; it's something that happens over time as a name becomes the creature's truth.

As a quick guide, a creature has a true name if it understands at least one language or it has an alignment.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

*2nd-level Onomancy feature*

You learn one language of your choice and gain proficiency with calligrapher's tools.

### Extract Name[]

*2nd-level Onomancy feature*

You can magically compel a creature to divulge its true name. As a bonus action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can't use this feature on the target again. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you mentally learn the charmed target's name or the fact that the target lacks a name.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Fateful Naming[]

*2nd-level Onomancy feature*

You can bend magic to assist or hinder creatures through the power of their true names, and even use those names as an anchor to affect others around them. The Bane and Bless spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook. You always have them prepared, yet they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast either spell without expending a spell slot if you speak the true name of one target of the spell as part of casting it. You can cast the spells in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Resonant Utterance[]

*6th-level Onomancy feature*

You learn words of power called Resonants, which allow you to tailor your spells through the use of a target's true name.

***Resonants Known.*** When you gain this feature, you learn two Resonants of your choice, which are detailed in the "Resonant Options" section. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one resonant you know with a different one.

***Using a Resonant.*** You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell.

You can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Resonant Options.*** Here are your options when choosing a Resonant:

* **Absorption.** When you cast a spell that deals damage to the named target, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d6 when you reach 10th level (4d6) and 14th level (5d6) in this class.
* **Devastation.** If the spell requires the named creature to make a saving throw, that creature has disadvantage on the first save it makes against the spell.
* **Dissolution.** The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage. The extra force damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 10th level (3d8) and 14th level (4d8) in this class.
* **Nullification.** If the named target is affected by any other spells, you know what those spells are, and you can attempt to end one of your choice by succeeding on an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spell.
* **Puppetry.** The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, you can knock the creature prone or move it up to 10 feet, either directly toward you or away from you.
* **Sympathy.** If the named creature is within range of the spell, you can target the creature with the spell even if you can't see the creature or it has total cover against spell.

### Inexorable Pronouncement[]

*10th-level Onomancy feature*

You learn two new Resonants of your choice from your Resonant Utterance feature.

### Relentless Naming[]

*14th-level Onomancy feature*

You have learned how to bypass a named creature's defenses against certain types of damage. When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature whose true name you speak as part of casting the spell, you can cause the spell to deal force or psychic damage to the creature, instead of the spell's normal damage type.

# Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard])

## Psionics[]

Wizards study magical power in all its forms, including the magic of psionics. Those wizards who follow the tradition of Psionics hone the magical potential of their own minds. Sometimes called psionicists or mentalists, these wizards interact with the multiverse through the lens of their psionic aptitude and awareness.

Psionicists channel their magic by focusing their minds. By doing so they can transcend their physical bodies, adopting forms of pure thought, casting spells psionically to bypass the need for components, and perceiving the world with a broader range of senses.

As a member of the Psionics tradition, you might have awoken your psionic potential through the strain of your esoteric studies, or perhaps you joined a scholarly order dedicated to unlocking the magic of the mind.

***Your Psionic Focus.*** Every member of the Psionics tradition has a story about how their psionic focus came into their life. Consider how you found yours and what form it takes.

The event that brought your psionic focus to you probably holds personal significance. Did your master give it to you upon the completion of your apprenticeship? Was it awarded to you when you graduated from your academy of wizardry? Did it call to you in a jeweler's shop? Was it associated with the moment when your psionic powers first manifested? One morning, did you wake up with it humming under your pillow?

The form your psionic focus takes is also yours to define, likely being a reflection of how your magic came into being, a symbol of your own psyche, or an item you use to focus your thoughts. It is a handheld object that has special meaning to you, but that can't be a weapon or magic item. Perhaps it's a childhood memento, the skull of an alien creature, a crystal that makes you feel a certain way, a coin that only lands on its edge, a fire-scarred planchette, or any other enigmatic personal relic.

However the object arrived and whatever form it takes, your psionic focus is now yours, and you decide how to handle it. Will you mount it on a wand or staff? Would you prefer to wear it on a necklace or circlet? Have you embedded it into the cover of your spellbook? Wherever you put it, you can now channel your magic through it, and it is a sign of your membership in the revered tradition of psionic wizardry.

### Psionic Focus[]

*2nd-level Psionics feature*

You have learned to channel psionic energy through a special object: a psionic focus. You gain the object with this feature.

While your psionic focus is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

* The object is a spellcasting focus for you.
* When you roll psychic or force damage for any of your wizard spells, you can reroll any of those damage dice that rolls a 1, but you must use the new roll.

If your psionic focus is lost, you can magically recreate it by meditating for 1 hour during a short or long rest, at the end of which the focus appears in your hand.

### Psionic Devotion[]

*2nd-level Psionics feature*

Your study of psionics begins to unleash your mind's potential. When you gain this feature, choose one of the following cantrips: Friends, Mage Hand, or Message. You learn that cantrip if you don't already know it, and it doesn't count against the number of wizard cantrips you know.

While your psionic focus is on your person, you can cast the chosen cantrip as a bonus action, requiring no components, and with the modification listed below:

* ***Friends.*** When the spell ends, the target doesn't become hostile to you.
* ***Mage Hand.*** You can make the hand invisible when you cast the spell, and controlling the spell is a bonus action for you.
* ***Message.*** You don't need to point toward the target or whisper your message out loud.

### Thought Form[]

*6th-level Psionics feature*

While you are carrying your psionic focus, you can use a bonus action to magically transform your body into pure psionic energy. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to assume your normal form, or until you are incapacitated or die.

While in thought form, you are a figure of luminous psychic energy, with your psionic focus hovering within. Your form can appear as anything you wish, but it is obviously magical, is the same size as you, and sheds dim light in a 5-foot-radius. Any other equipment you are wearing or carrying transforms with you and melds into your thought form. You also gain the following benefits:

* **Psionic Spellcasting.** When you cast a spell while in thought form, you can cast the spell psionically. If you do so, the spell doesn't require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.
* **Psychic Resilience.** You gain resistance to psychic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

You can transform using this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Mental Discipline[]

*10th-level Psionics feature*

Your mind's power expands to greater heights. When you gain this feature, choose one of the following spells: Dominate Person, Scrying, or Telekinesis. You can add the spell to your spellbook, and you can cast it without components.

You can also cast the chosen spell once without expending a spell slot. After you do so, you regain the ability to cast the spell without a slot when you finish a long rest.

### Empowered Psionics[]

*10th-level Psionics feature*

When you deal psychic or force damage with a wizard spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage against one of the spell's targets.

### Thought Travel[]

*14th-level Psionics feature*

While using your Thought Form, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.

# Three Subclasses[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Three Subclasses])

## School of Invention[]

The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic — a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse.

Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.

Many wizards of this tradition are gnomes, alchemists, or both, and they take pride in the magic-infused armor they don. The armor not only provides protection, but it is also designed to help the wizard channel magic in unpredictable ways.

Wizards of this tradition are regarded as savants to their faces, but wizards of other traditions often think of them as lunatics.

### Tools of the Inventor[]

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with two tools of your choice.

### Arcanomechanical Armor[]

Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of arcane armor.

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of arcanomechanical armor — a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage.

The armor is light armor and provides an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. It weighs 8 pounds.

You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous arcanomechanical armor, turning it in to nonmagical studded leather.

### Reckless Casting[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can attempt to cast a spell you don't have prepared. When you use this ability, you use your action and choose one of the following options:

* Roll on the Reckless Casting table for cantrips and cast the resulting spell as part of this action.
* Expend a spell slot and roll twice on the Reckless Casting table for its level, or the 5th-level table if the slot is 6th level or higher. Pick which of the two results you want to use and cast the resulting spell as part of this action. If the spell you cast isn't a wizard spell, it is nonetheless a wizard spell for you when you cast it with this feature.

### Alchemical Casting[]

At 6th level, you learn to channel magic through your arcanomechanical armor to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell while wearing that armor and attuned to it, you can expend one additional spell slot of 1st or 2nd level to alter the spell. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.

A 1st-level slot allows you to manipulate the spell's energy. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type for another one from that list.

A 2nd-level slot increases the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase that damage by 2d10 force damage against one of the spell's targets (your choice) this turn.

### Prodigious Inspiration[]

At 10th level, you have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. As a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook. You can't use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Controlled Chaos[]

At 14th level, your ability to improvise magic grows stronger. Whenever you roll on a Reckless Casting table for a spell other than a cantrip, you can roll on the table that is one level higher than the expended spell slot.

# Modern Magic[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic])

## Technomancy[]

Unlike the more common arcane traditions based around the schools of magic, the tradition of Technomancy does not focus on a singular type of spellcraft or magical energy. Rather, students of Technomancy concern themselves with how their spells interact with modern technology.

Technomancers can make use of technology as both a conduit and a storage space for magic. In a campaign using the optional rules for magic item creation, a technomancer might craft disposable electronic devices and smartphone apps in lieu of potions and scrolls.

### Bonus Proficiencies[]

Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with sidearms and hacking tools.

### Technological Savant[]

Also at 2nd level, you trade out your spellbook for a specially attuned storage device of your choosing, capable of recording magical data. The computing power of this device must be equal to or greater than a tablet computer. Only one storage device can be attuned to you at any given time. Spells can be copied into this device at half the cost of copying spells into a spellbook.

### Program Spell[]

At 6th level, you can insert a spell within an electronic device of your choosing, so that by touching a key or flicking a switch using an action, the spell activates. All variables of the spell are set at the time of casting. The computing power of this device must be equal to or greater than a mobile phone.

A programmed spell remains placed in its device for 48 hours, and is gone once it is discharged. You can use this feature to place a programmed spell in only one device at a time, and a device can hold only one programmed spell. Only you can activate the programmed spell in the device. If the device is destroyed, the programmed spell is lost.

A concentration spell placed in a device cannot be activated while you are concentrating on another spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Online Casting[]

At 10th level, you can cast spells through networked electronic devices, including cameras, mobile phones, and computers. For example, if a creature is under the observation of a security camera and you can see the video feed from that camera on a computer, you can cast a spell into the computer and out through the security camera to target that creature.

If the spell requires the caster to be seen, the target must see you or a live image of you. If the spell requires the caster to be heard, the target must be able to hear you or a live audio transmission of you. The spell's range is determined using the distance from you to your device, and then from the target to its device. You must be able to see or otherwise determine the location of the target. This feature can be used to cast only spells that target specific creatures. Spells that affect an area are not subject to online casting.

This feature can be used a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).

### Chained Device[]

By 14th level, you have learned to imprint vestiges of your consciousness on electronic devices with significant computing power. When you cast a concentration spell, you can use a device whose computing power is equal to or greater than a tablet computer to maintain concentration of the spell on your behalf. The device must be held or worn by you to maintain this effect. If the device is destroyed, taken from you, dropped, or turned off, the concentration ends. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Wizard Revisited[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Wizard Revisited])

## Theurgy[]

A number of deities claim arcane magic as their domain, for magic is as much a part of the fabric of the cosmos as wind, fire, lightning, and all other primal forces. Just as there are deities of the sea and gods of warfare, the arcane arts feature their own divine patrons.

Such deities often have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.

### Divine Inspiration[]

When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, choose a domain from your chosen deity's list of eligible domains. The Knowledge and Light domains are especially appropriate choices for a theurgist.

### Arcane Initiate[]

Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, whenever you gain a wizard level, you can replace one of the wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a cleric domain spell for your chosen domain. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

If you add all of your domain spells to your spellbook, you can subsequently add any spell from the cleric spell list instead. The spell must still be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Any cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a wizard spell for you, but other wizards can't copy cleric spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.

### Channel Arcana[]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel arcane energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Arcana and the Channel Divinity option granted at 2nd level by your chosen domain. You employ that Channel Divinity option by using your Channel Arcana ability.

When you use your Channel Arcana, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Arcana again.

Some Channel Arcana effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect, the save DC equals your wizard spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Arcana twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

If you gain additional Channel Divinity options from your domain, you can employ them by using your Channel Arcana feature.

#### Channel Arcana: Divine Arcana[]

As a bonus action, you speak a prayer to control the flow of magic around you. The next spell you cast gains a +2 bonus to any attack roll you make for it or to its saving throw DC, as appropriate.

### Arcane Acolyte[]

At 6th level, you gain your chosen domain's 1st-level benefits. However, you do not gain any weapon or armor proficiencies from the domain.

### Arcane Priest[]

At 10th level, you gain your chosen domain's 6th-level benefits. Your faith and your understanding of magic allow you to delve into your god's secrets.

### Arcane High Priest[]

At 14th level, you gain your chosen domain's 17th-level benefits. Your academic nature and understanding of magic and doctrine allow you to master this ability sooner than a cleric of your domain.
