### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 52)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a paladin. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Additional Paladin Spells[]

*2nd-level paladin feature*

The spells in the following list expand the paladin spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Ritual | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2nd | Gentle Repose | Necromancy | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Yes |  | PHB 245 |
| 2nd | Prayer of Healing | Evocation | 10 minutes | V |  |  |  | PHB 267 |
| 2nd | Warding Bond | Abjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 50gp |  |  | PHB 287 |
| 3rd | Spirit Shroud | Necromancy | 1 bonus action | V, S |  |  | Yes | TCE 108 |
| 5th | Summon Celestial | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 500gp |  | Yes | TCE 110 |

#### Fighting Style Options[]

*2nd-level paladin feature*

When you choose a fighting style, the following styles are added to your list of options.

***Blessed Warrior.*** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.

***Blind Fighting.*** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

***Interception.*** When a creature you can see hits a target other than you within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

#### Harness Divine Power[]

*3rd-level paladin feature*

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class. 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Martial Versatility[]

*4th-level paladin feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

## Basic Features[]

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per paladin level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per paladin level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

### Equipment[]

* (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
* (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
* (a) a Priest's Pack or (b) an Explorer's Pack
* Chain mail and a holy symbol

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

## Divine Sense[]

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Lay on Hands[]

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Fighting Style[]

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

## Spellcasting[]

By 2nd level, you can cast paladin spells.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

## Divine Smite[]

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

## Divine Health[]

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

## Sacred Oath[]

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

* Oath of the Ancients (Player's Handbook, page 86)
* Oath of Conquest (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 37)
* Oath of the Crown (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 132)
* Oath of Devotion (Player's Handbook, page 85)
* Oath of Glory (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 53; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 29)
* Oath of Redemption (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 38)
* Oath of Vengeance (Player's Handbook, page 87)
* Oath of the Watchers (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 54)
* Oathbreaker (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 97)

### Oath Spells[]

Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

### Breaking Your Oath[]

A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress their oath.

A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares their faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.

If a paladin willfully violates their oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker or Oath of Treachery paladin option.

### Channel Divinity[]

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack[]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Aura of Protection[]

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Aura of Courage[]

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Improved Divine Smite[]

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

## Cleansing Touch[]

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Oath of the Ancients[]

(Player's Handbook, page 86)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Ensnaring Strike, Speak With Animals |
| 5th | Misty Step, Moonbeam |
| 9th | Plant Growth, Protection From Energy |
| 13th | Ice Storm, Stoneskin |
| 17th | Commune With Nature, Tree Stride |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Nature's Wrath:** You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.
* **Turn the Faithless:** You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

:   A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
:   If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

### Aura of Warding[]

Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Undying Sentinel[]

Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.

### Elder Champion[]

At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.

Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

* At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
* Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
* Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Conquest[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 37)

### Oath of Conquest Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Armor of Agathys, Command |
| 5th | Hold Person, Spiritual Weapon |
| 9th | Bestow Curse, Fear |
| 13th | Dominate Beast, Stoneskin |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Dominate Person |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Conquering Presence:** You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
* **Guided Strike:** You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Aura of Conquest[]

Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Scornful Rebuke[]

Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not incapacitated.

### Invincible Conqueror[]

At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You have resistance to all damage.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
* Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of the Crown[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 132)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Command, Compelled Duel |
| 5th | Warding Bond, Zone of Truth |
| 9th | Aura of Vitality, Spirit Guardians |
| 13th | Banishment, Guardian of Faith |
| 17th | Circle of Power, Geas |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Champion Challenge:** As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you.
* **Turn the Tide:** As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.

### Divine Allegiance[]

Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

### Unyielding Spirit[]

Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.

### Exalted Champion[]

At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour:

* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
* Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.
* You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 ft. of you.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Devotion[]

(Player's Handbook, page 85)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Protection From Evil and Good, Sanctuary |

| 13th | Freedom of Movement, Guardian of Faith |
| 17th | Commune, Flame Strike |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Sacred Weapon:** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

:   You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

* **Turn the Unholy:** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

:   A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Aura of Devotion[]

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Purity of Spirit[]

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a Protection From Evil and Good spell.

### Holy Nimbus[]

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Glory[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 53; Mythic Odysseys of Theros, page 29)

### Channel Divinity[]

*3rd-level Oath of Glory feature*

You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Di­vinity works.

* **Peerless Athlete:** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).
* **Inspiring Smite:** Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

### Aura of Alacrity[]

*7th- and 18th-level Oath of Glory feature*

You emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 10 feet.

### Glorious Defense[]

*15th-level Oath of Glory feature*

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Living Legend[]

*20th-level Oath of Glory feature*

You can empower yourself with the legends — whether true or exaggerated — of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.
* Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
* If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

## Oath of Redemption[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 38)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Sanctuary, Sleep |
| 5th | Calm Emotions, Hold Person |
| 9th | Counterspell, Hypnotic Pattern |
| 13th | Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, Stoneskin |
| 17th | Hold Monster, Wall of Force |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Emissary of Peace:** You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.
* **Rebuke the Violent:** You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

### Aura of the Guardian[]

Starting at 7th level, you can shield others from harm at the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Protective Spirit[]

Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your wounds in battle. You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren't incapacitated.

### Emissary of Redemption[]

At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which gives you two benefits:

* You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).
* Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack.

If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of Vengeance[]

(Player's Handbook, page 87)

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Bane, Hunter's Mark |
| 5th | Hold Person, Misty Step |
| 9th | Haste, Protection From Energy |
| 13th | Banishment, Dimension Door |
| 17th | Hold Monster, Scrying |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Abjure Enemy:** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.

:   On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
:   On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

* **Vow of Enmity:** As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.

### Relentless Avenger[]

By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Soul of Vengeance[]

Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.

### Avenging Angel[]

At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:

* Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
* You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Oath of the Watchers[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 54)

### Oath Spells[]

*3rd-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Watchers table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Alarm, Detect Magic |
| 5th | Moonbeam, See Invisibility |
| 9th | Counterspell, Nondetection |
| 13th | Aura of Purity, Banishment |
| 17th | Hold Monster, Scrying |

### Channel Divinity[]

*3rd-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You gain the following Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

***Watcher's Will.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to invest your presence with the warding power of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Abjure the Extraplanar.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an action, you present your holy symbol and each aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can take the Dodge action.

### Aura of the Sentinel[]

*7th-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You emit an aura of alertness while you aren't incapacitated. When you and any creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you roll initiative, you all gain a bonus to initiative equal to your proficiency bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Vigilant Rebuke[]

*15th-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You've learned how to chastise anyone who dares wield beguilements against you and your wards. Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to deal 2d8 + your Charisma modifier force damage to the creature that forced the saving throw.

### Mortal Bulwark[]

*20th-level Oath of the Watchers feature*

You manifest a spark of divine power in defense of the mortal realms. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.
* You have advantage on attack rolls against aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends.
* When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

## Oathbreaker[]

(Dungeon Master's Guide, page 97)

### Oathbreaker Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Hellish Rebuke, Inflict Wounds |
| 5th | Crown of Madness, Darkness |
| 9th | Animate Dead, Bestow Curse |
| 13th | Blight, Confusion |
| 17th | Contagion, Dominate Person |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Control Undead:** As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect.
* **Dreadful Aspect:** As an action, you channel the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see you. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.

### Aura of Hate[]

Starting at 7th level, you, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of you, gain a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Supernatural Resistance[]

At 15th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

### Dread Lord[]

At 20th level, you can, as an action, surround yourself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around you to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by you starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, you and creatures you choose in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.

While the aura lasts, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. You make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + your Charisma modifier.

After activating the aura, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Waterborne Adventures[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures])

## Fighting Style[]

### Mariner[]

As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

# Light, Dark, Underdark![]

(Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, and Underdark!])

## Fighting Style[]

### Close Quarters Shooter[]

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

### Tunnel Fighter[]

You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.

# Class Feature Variants[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants])

## Fighting Style Options[]

*2nd-level paladin feature (enhances Fighting Style)*

### Thrown Weapon Fighting[]

You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.

### Unarmed Fighter[]

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.

# Sacred Oaths[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Sacred Oaths])

## Oath of Treachery[]

The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure.

Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery.

***Fallen Paladins.*** The Oath of Treachery is an option for the paladin who has strayed from another Sacred Oath or who has rejected the traditional paladin life. This option exists alongside the Oathbreaker. DMs are free to use either option to model villainous or fallen paladins.

If you switch to this oath from another one, replace all of the previous oath's features with the features of this one, and if you renounce this oath, replace its features with the features of the new one.

### Tenets of Treachery[]

A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard's overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others.

### Oath Spells[]

| Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Charm Person, Expeditious Retreat |
| 5th | Invisibility, Mirror Image |
| 9th | Gaseous Form, Haste |
| 13th | Confusion, Greater Invisibility |
| 17th | Dominate Person, Passwall |

### Channel Divinity[]

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* ***Conjure Duplicate.*** As an action, you create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, doesn't occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you.

:   For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.

* ***Poison Strike.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your paladin level, or 20 + your paladin level if you had advantage on the attack roll.

### Aura of Treachery[]

Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of discord, which gives you the following benefits.

* ***Cull the Herd.*** You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.
* ***Treacherous Strike.*** If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed.

:   You can use this ability three times. You regain expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Blackguard's Escape[]

At 15th level, you have the ability to slip away from your foes. Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Icon of Deceit[]

At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of deceit, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You are invisible.
* If a creature damages you on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren't incapacitated when it takes the action. A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.
* If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain a bonus to its damage roll equal to your paladin level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
