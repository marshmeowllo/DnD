# Druid Circles and Wild Shape[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Druid Circles and Wild Shape)

## Circle of Twilight[]

The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

### Harvest's Scythe[]

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a spell, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic damage. If you kill one or more hostile creatures with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Speech Beyond the Grave[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to reach beyond death's veil in search of knowledge. Using this feature, you can cast Speak With Dead without material components, and you understand what the target of this casting says. It can understand your questions, even if you don't share a language or it is not intelligent enough to speak.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Watcher at the Threshold[]

At 10th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. In addition, while you aren't incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you has advantage on death saving throws.

### Paths of the Dead[]

At 14th level, your mastery of death allows you to tread the paths used by ghosts and other spirits. Using this feature, you can cast Etherealness. Once the spell ends, you can't cast it with this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Optional Class Features[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 35)

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a druid. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### Additional Druid Spells[]

*1st-level druid feature*

The spells in the following list expand the druid spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

| Level | Name | School | Casting Time | Components | Cost | Save | Ritual | Conc. | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | Protection From Evil and Good | Abjuration | 1 action | V, S, M |  |  |  | Yes | PHB 270 |
| 2nd | Augury | Divination | 1 minute | V, S, M | 25gp |  |  |  | PHB 215 |
| 2nd | Continual Flame | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M | 50gp |  |  |  | PHB 227 |

| 4th | Fire Shield | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  |  |  |  | PHB 242 |
| 4th | Summon Elemental | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S, M | 400gp |  |  | Yes | TCE 111 |
| 5th | Cone of Cold | Evocation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution |  |  | PHB 224 |
| 6th | Flesh to Stone | Transmutation | 1 action | V, S, M |  | Constitution |  | Yes | PHB 243 |
| 7th | Symbol | Abjuration | 1 minute | V, S, M | 1000gp |  |  |  | PHB 280 |
| 8th | Incendiary Cloud | Conjuration | 1 action | V, S |  | Dexterity |  | Yes | PHB 253 |

#### Wild Companion[]

*2nd-level druid feature*

You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form; as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the Find Familiar spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

#### Cantrip Versatility[]

*4th-level druid feature*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

## Basic Features[]

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dnd-5e/images/9/9d/Druid.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20221129095716)

### Hit Points[]

* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per druid level after 1st

### Proficiencies[]

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids don't use armor/shields made of metal)
* **Weapons:** Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears
* **Tools:** Herbalism kit
* **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
* **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival

### Equipment[]

* (a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
* Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 2d4 x 10 gp.

## Druidic[]

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

## Spellcasting[]

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

### Cantrips[]

You know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.

### Preparing and Casting Spells[]

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability[]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting[]

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus[]

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

## Wild Shape[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

| Level | Max CR | Limitations | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | 1 | None | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

## Druid Circle[]

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

* Circle of Dreams (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 22)
* Circle of the Land (Player's Handbook, page 68)
* Circle of the Moon (Player's Handbook, page 69)
* Circle of the Shepherd (Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 23)
* Circle of Spores (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 36; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 26)
* Circle of Stars (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 38)
* Circle of Wildfire (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 39)

## Ability Score Improvement[]

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Timeless Body[]

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

## Beast Spells[]

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.

## Archdruid[]

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

## Circle of Dreams[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 22)

### Balm of the Summer Court[]

At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow[]

At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

### Hidden Paths[]

Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Walker in Dreams[]

At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.

When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: Dream (with you as the messenger), Scrying, or Teleportation Circle.

This use of Teleportation Circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of the Land[]

(Player's Handbook, page 68)

### Bonus Cantrip[]

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn't count against the number of druid cantrips you know.

### Natural Recovery[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

### Circle Spells[]

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Land's Stride[]

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

### Nature's Ward[]

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

### Nature's Sanctuary[]

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

## Circle of the Moon[]

(Player's Handbook, page 69)

### Combat Wild Shape[]

You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

### Circle Forms[]

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1.

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

### Primal Strike[]

Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Elemental Wild Shape[]

At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.

### Thousand Forms[]

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the Alter Self spell at will.

## Circle of the Shepherd[]

(Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 23)

### Speech of the Woods[]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.

You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

### Spirit Totem[]

Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

* **Bear Spirit:** The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.
* **Hawk Spirit:** The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.
* **Unicorn Spirit:** The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.

### Mighty Summoner[]

Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:

* The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.
* The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Guardian Spirit[]

Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.

### Faithful Summons[]

Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of Conjure Animals as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of Spores[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 36; Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 96)

### Circle Spells[]

*2nd-level Circle of Spores feature*

Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the Chill Touch cantrip.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Blindness/Deafness, Gentle Repose |
| 5th | Animate Dead, Gaseous Form |
| 7th | Blight, Confusion |
| 9th | Cloudkill, Contagion |

### Halo of Spores[]

*2nd-level Circle of Spores feature*

You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

### Symbiotic Entity[]

*2nd-level Circle of Spores feature*

You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

* When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
* Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

### Fungal Infestation[]

*6th-level Circle of Spores feature*

Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Spreading Spores[]

*10th-level Circle of Spores feature*

You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.
While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.

### Fungal Body[]

*14th-level Circle of Spores feature*

The fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.

## Circle of Stars[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 38)

### Star Map[]

*2nd-level Circle of Stars feature*

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

| d6 | Map Form |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A scroll covered with depictions of constellations |
| 2 | A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it |
| 3 | A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks |
| 4 | A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover |
| 5 | A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light |
| 6 | Glass disks that depict constellations |

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

* You know the Guidance cantrip.
* You have the Guiding Bolt spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
* You can cast Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.

### Starry Form[]

*2nd-level Circle of Stars feature*

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in a starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:

**Archer.** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**Chalice.** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**Dragon.** A constellation of a wise, ancient dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

### Cosmic Omen[]

*6th-level Circle of the Stars feature*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Twinkling Constellations[]

*10th-level Circle of Stars feature*

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

### Full of Stars[]

*14th-level Circle of the Stars feature*

While your Starry Form feature is active, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Circle of Wildfire[]

(Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, page 39)

### Circle Spells[]

*2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

You have formed a mystical bond with a wildfire spirit, a primal being of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you access to certain spells as shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 2nd | Burning Hands, Cure Wounds |
| 3rd | Flaming Sphere, Scorching Ray |
| 5th | Plant Growth, Revivify |
| 7th | Aura of Life, Fire Shield |
| 9th | Flame Strike, Mass Cure Wounds |

### Summon Wildfire[]

*2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

### Enhanced Bond[]

*6th-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.

### Cauterizing Flames[]

*10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

You gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal the creature or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Blazing Revival[]

*14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature*

The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall unconscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your hit points and immediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Giant Options[]

(Unearthed Arcana 2022: Giant Options])

## Circle of the Primeval[]

The Circle of the Primeval teaches that, though the land may change over time, it never truly forgets. By tapping into the timeworn memory of the earth, these druids summon and bond with the spirit of a primeval behemoth—a hulking creature that once ruled the ancient world alongside the giants. The most well-known primeval behemoths are the dinosaurs, but spirits bonded with members of the Circle of the Primeval have also taken the form of ancient predecessors to today’s common beasts and other fantastical titanic creatures.

Working alongside their companion spirit, most druids of the Circle of the Primeval spend their lives delving into long-forgotten places and preserving the remnants of bygone eras. As a druid’s power grows, so does their companion, the beast starting near equal in size to its druid partner before increasing in stature until it too towers over the land.

### Keeper of Old[]

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, your connection to the mighty primeval behemoths allows you new insight into the ancient world.

You gain proficiency in the History skill. When you make an Intelligence (History) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Primeval Companion[]

Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can call upon the primeval creature whose spirit is bound to you. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your primeval companion, rather than assuming a beast form. The companion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you.

The primeval companion is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Primeval Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You can determine the cosmetic appearance of the companion; for example, your companion may evoke ancient predators like raptors or saber-toothed tigers, or it might be more inclined for defense, appearing as an armored ankylosaurus or a wooly rhino. These choices have no effect on the companion’s game statistics.

In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The companion remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points or until you die, at which point the companion vanishes. If you use this feature to summon the companion again and you already have a companion present, the first companion immediately vanishes. Anything the companion was wearing or carrying is left behind when the companion vanishes.

### Prehistoric Conduit[]

At 6th level, You learn how to channel your magic through your primeval companion. When you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your primeval companion.

In addition, if the primeval companion is affected by a spell you cast that allows creatures to make a savingthrow against its effects, the primeval companion has advantage on its saving throw. If the primeval companion would normally take half damage on a successful save against this spell, the companion instead takes no damage on a successful save and half damage with no additional effects on a failed save.

### Titanic Bond[]

At 10th level, The primeval companion grows to Large size, and when you summon it, you can grant it either a climbing speed or a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.

In turn, the primeval companion lends you some of its terrifying might. Once per turn while your primeval companion is summoned, when you hit a creature with an attack or deal damage to a creature you can see with a spell you cast, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC; on a failure, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Scourge of the Ancients[]

At 14th level, you have learned to fully harness the titanic legacy of your companion. As part of the bonus action you use to command your companion, you can expend a spell slot of any level to heighten your primeval companion’s might, granting it the following benefits:

**Hulking Behemoth.** The companion becomes Huge and gains temporary hit points equal to 10 times the level of the spell slot expended. If there isn’t enough room for the companion to become Huge, it attains the maximum possible size in the space available.

**Mauler.** On a hit, the companion’s Strike deals additional damage equal to 1d8 plus the level of the spell slot expended.

**Titanic Stride.** The companion’s walking speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot expended.

These benefits last for 1 hour, until the companion vanishes, or until you expend a spell slot for this feature again.

# Mages of Strixhaven[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven])

## Using These Subclasses[]

Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass's entry.

### Choosing the Subclass[]

When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard's Bardic College, a wizard's Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character's class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.

How the subclass manifests in your character's story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer's innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron's usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.

### At Higher Levels[]

Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character's class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as "Level 6+," your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you're a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.

When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History's Whims feature, but not both.

## Mage of Prismari[]

Mages of Prismari use surges of elemental energy to express who they are and how they see the world. To them, magic and motion are one and the same; both are exhibitions of raw creativity through which masterpieces are made. In their pursuit of the arts, some Prismari mages focus on perfecting the fine details of their technique, while others prefer to unleash their wild creative visions in dazzling spectacles of elemental power.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Prismari subclass, you gain two features: Creative Skills and Kinetic Artistry.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Prismari counts as your circle; if you're a sorcerer, the magic of the college is the origin of your sorcery; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Creative Skills[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, or Performance.

### Kinetic Artistry[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You can Dash as a bonus action. When you take this bonus action, choose one of the following additional effects:

**Boreal Sweep.** Icy water swirls around you. Until the end of your turn, you can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless solid ground. Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.

**Scorching Whirl.** Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier.

**Thunderlight Jaunt.** You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

You can use a bonus action in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Favored Medium[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You have honed your forms of elemental expression to best suit your ideas. Choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. You gain resistance to that damage type.

Additionally, when you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals the chosen damage type, you emit a spectacular aura of artistry, which extends 5 feet from you in every direction (but not through total cover) and lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, each creature of your choice has resistance to your chosen damage type while within the aura, as you shape your favored elemental medium around them.

You can change your choice of damage type whenever you finish a long rest.

### Focused Expression[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Honing your talents, you skillfully infuse your motions with even more potent expressions of elemental might. Once per turn when you deal damage to at least one target, you gain an additional effect determined by the damage type chosen for your Favored Medium feature:

**Cold.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 cold damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, as ice mires it. A target can be affected by the ice only once per round.

**Fire.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 fire damage. Fortifying flames then dance around one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature gains 1d6 temporary hit points.

**Lightning.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional 1d6 lightning damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn, as residual lightning shocks its form.

### Impeccable Physicality[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Your relentless dedication and training have instilled an outstanding sense of precision and grace in your art. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if you do not already have it. Additionally, when you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can treat a d20 roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.

## Mage of Witherbloom[]

Mages of Witherbloom draw their magic from the energy that endlessly flows from life to death, and back again. They see the duality of thriving life and inevitable death in all things, tapping and manipulating the transition of energy between these states. Some Witherbloom adherents focus on vital energies to nurture life and empower others, while others embrace the drain of vitality into decay to sap and strike down their foes.

### Using This Subclass[]

Upon selecting the Mage of Witherbloom subclass, you gain two features: Witherbloom Spells and Essence Tap.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Witherbloom counts as your circle, and if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Witherbloom Spells[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You learn the cantrip Spare the Dying and the 1st-level spells Cure Wounds and Inflict Wounds. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Witherbloom Spells table.

Each of these spells count as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a druid, you always have the spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

| Class Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Lesser Restoration, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5th | Revivify, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Blight, Greater Restoration |
| 9th | Antilife Shell, Mass Cure Wounds |

### Essence Tap[]

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

As a bonus action, you can draw on a reservoir of life essence to empower yourself for 1 minute, or until you use this feature again. For the duration, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

**Overgrowth.** When you choose this benefit, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while the benefit lasts, you can expend and roll one Hit Die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Withering Strike.** When you deal damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic, and you ignore resistance to necrotic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Witherbloom Brew[]

*Level 6+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You gain proficiency with herbalism kits if you don't already have it.

When you finish a long rest, you can use an herbalism kit and a pot or cauldron to create magical brews. You create a number of brews equal to your proficiency bonus. Each brew requires its own flask. A brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. For each brew, choose one of the following effects:

**Fortifying.** When you create this brew, choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or radiant. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient gains resistance to the chosen damage type for 1 hour.

**Quickening.** A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 2d6 hit points, and one disease or condition from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user's choice): charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.

**Toxifying.** As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The next time the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature within 1 hour, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute.

### Witherbloom Adept[]

*Level 10+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

Your connection to the flow of life force deepens. Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage or restore hit points using a spell, one target of the spell takes additional damage or regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Withering Vortex[]

*Level 14+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

When you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals necrotic damage to any number of creatures that aren't Undead or Constructs, choose one of the creatures that took damage. You drain an amount of life energy equal to half the damage dealt to the chosen creature. One creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the life energy drained.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Druid Circles and Wild Shape[]

([Unearthed Arcana: Druid Circles and Wild Shape])

## Circle of Twilight[]

The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

### Harvest's Scythe[]

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a spell, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic damage. If you kill one or more hostile creatures with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Speech Beyond the Grave[]

At 6th level, you gain the ability to reach beyond death's veil in search of knowledge. Using this feature, you can cast Speak With Dead without material components, and you understand what the target of this casting says. It can understand your questions, even if you don't share a language or it is not intelligent enough to speak.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Watcher at the Threshold[]

At 10th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. In addition, while you aren't incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you has advantage on death saving throws.

### Paths of the Dead[]

At 14th level, your mastery of death allows you to tread the paths used by ghosts and other spirits. Using this feature, you can cast Etherealness. Once the spell ends, you can't cast it with this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
