# Eladrin

From Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 13.

## Traits[]

As an eladrin, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a elf.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

***Fey Step.*** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gain an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this race):

* **Autumn.** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to the creatures.
* **Winter.** When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
* **Spring.** When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.
* **Summer.** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Trance.*** You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

Whenever you finish this trance, you can change your season, and you can gain two proficiencies that you don't have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the Player's Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.

## Traits[]

(Player's Handbook, page 21)

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

***Size.*** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

***Trance.*** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.

The material in this article is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not refined by full game design and editing.

## Contents

    - 1.1.1 Autumn
    - 1.1.2 Winter

## Race Options: Eladrin and Gith[]

(Unearthed Arcana: Race Options: Eladrin and Gith])

Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of unpredictability and boundless magic. At your DM's option, you can select eladrin as the subrace for an elf character, instead of one of the elf subraces in the Player's Handbook.

As creatures of the Feywild, eladrin can be wildly unpredictable. They tend toward an alignment of chaotic neutral, mixing a love of
freedom with benign self-interest. Eladrin that embrace good or evil take their beliefs to an extreme, serving as great champions of justice or terrifying villains.

### The Four Seasons[]

Each eladrin has four distinct personality states — one for each season — that they shift between when they experience powerful emotion.

**Autumn** is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all. Eladrin adopt this personality when overcome with contentment.

**Winter** is the season of dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. It is a time of sadness and regret, entered when eladrin are overcome with sorrow.

**Spring** is the season of cheerfulness and unfettered celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with joy.

**Summer** is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with fury.

You may create personality traits and flaws for each of your seasons, reflecting an eladrin's tempestuous personality. You can roll on the following tables or read them for inspiration. To add some chaos to your character, you may roll on these tables each time you change seasons.

#### Autumn[]

| 3 | The world is full of dangers. You never let your guard drop. |
| 4 | A penny spent is a penny lost forever. |

| 2 | Nothing matters to you, and you allow others to guide your actions. |
| 3 | Your needs come first. In winter, all must watch out for themselves. |
| 4 | You speak only to point out the flaws in others' plans. |

| d4 | Spring Personality Trait |

#### Summer[]

| d4 | Summer Personality Trait |
| --- | --- |

| 2 | Overwhelming force can solve almost anything. The tougher the problem, the more force you apply. |
| 3 | You stand tall and strong so that others can lean on you. |
| 4 | You maintain an intimidating front. Better to prevent fights with a show of force than be led to harm others. |

| d4 | Summer Flaw |

| 3 | Punch first. Talk later. |

### Eladrin Traits[]

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Intelligence score or your Charisma score increases by 1.
* **Fey Step:** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
* **Shifting Seasons:** At the end of each short or long rest, you can align yourself with the magic of one season, regardless of the season that is dominating your personality. Doing so allows you to cast a certain cantrip, as shown in the Shifting Seasons Cantrips table. When you align yourself with a season's magic, you lose the cantrip associated with the previous season and gain the cantrip associated with the new season.

:   Your spellcasting ability for these cantrips is Intelligence or Charisma, whichever is higher.

| Season | Cantrip |
| --- | --- |
| Spring | Minor Illusion |
| Summer | Fire Bolt |
| Autumn | Friends |
| Winter | Chill Touch |

## Elf Subraces[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Elf Subraces])

### Avariel[]

The avariel are winged elves. These rare creatures were more common when the worlds of the multiverse were young, but frequent conflicts with dragons much reduced the winged elves' number. Still, a few colonies persist here and there in the Material Plane and on the Plane of Air.

* **Extra Language:** You can speak, read, and write Auran.
* **Flight:** You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

### Grugach[]

The grugach of the world of Greyhawk shun contact with other folk, preferring the solace of the deepest forests and the companionship of wild animals. Even other elves draw their suspicion.

The grugach tend toward chaos and neutrality. They feel no special duty to anyone beyond their own folk and the forest that is their home. Troubles beyond their borders are best kept there. At the same time, they harbor little ambition beyond a peaceful coexistence with nature.

If anyone is fool enough to disturb a grugach realm, these elves take to arms and fight in earnest. Grugach master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper's nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. The grugach set pits filled with stakes, snares that leave an intruder helpless to grugach arrows, and other snares designed to kill rather than capture. The grugach fight to the death to preserve their realms.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 1.
* **Grugach Weapon Training:** You have proficiency with the spear, shortbow, longbow, and net.
* **Cantrip:** You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.
* **Extra Language:** You don't know Common. Instead, you can speak, read, and write Sylvan.

### Shadar-kai[]

Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were elves like the rest of their kin, but now they exist in a strange state between life and death, their skin pale and their bodies marked by piercings and eerie tattoos.

* **Extra Language:** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choosing.
* **Cantrip:** You know one of the following cantrips of your choice: Chill Touch, Spare the Dying, or Thaumaturgy. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
* **Blessing of the Raven Queen:** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and you gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
