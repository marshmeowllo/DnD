## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 8)

As a bugbear, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a goblinoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a goblinoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Sneaky.*** You are proficient in the Stealth skill. In addition, without squeezing, you can move through and stop in a space large enough for a Small creature.

***Surprise Attack.*** If you hit a creature with an attack roll, the creature takes an extra 2d6 damage if it hasn't taken a turn yet in the current combat.

### Goblinkin and the Curse of Strife[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 174)

Whenever a goblinkin returns to consciousness after being reduced to 0 hit points, they can make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if they were brought back to life. On a success, the goblinkin breaks free from the curse of strife. A goblinkin targeted by Remove Curse can also make this saving throw, with advantage on the save if the caster is a trusted companion.
