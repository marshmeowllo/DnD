The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this race).

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Creating Your Character[]

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you create a character using the race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. The race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

* **Size:** Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:
  + Size modifier = 2d8
  + Height = 5 feet + 4 inches + your size modifier in inches
  + Weight in pounds = 175 + (2d6 x your size modifier)
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Horns:** Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Size.*** Minotaurs typically stand well over 6 feet tall and weigh an average of 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Horns.*** You are never unarmed. You are proficient with your horns, which are a melee weapon that deals 1d10 piercing damage. Your horns grant you advantage on all checks made to shove a creature, but not to avoid being shoved yourself.

# Naga

From Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 21.

## Traits[]

All naga share the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Like humans, naga reach adulthood in their late teens. They show no signs of aging beyond that point except for growing larger, so in theory, a naga could live well over a century.

***Alignment.*** Most naga are either neutral or neutral evil in alignment.

***Size.*** Naga stand about 5 feet tall when upright, but the total length of their bodies, head to tail, ranges from 10 to as much as 20 feet. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Speed Burst.*** By lowering your body to the ground and propelling yourself with your arms, you can move more quickly for a time. As a bonus action on your turn, if you have both hands free, you can increase your walking speed by 5 feet until the end of your turn.

***Natural Weapons.*** Your fanged maw and constricting serpentine body are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

If you hit with your bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, and your target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 poison damage.

If you hit with your constrict attack, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and the target is grappled (escape DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and you can't constrict another target.

***Poison Immunity.*** You are immune to poison damage and can't be poisoned.

***Poison Affinity.*** You gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit.

***Languages.*** You can read and write Common and Naga.

## Creating Your Character[]

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you create a character using a race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

## Traits[]

You have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

***Ancestral Legacy.*** If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Revenant

From Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Heroes.

**Consult your DM before using this race.**

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

The revenant subrace can be applied to any race that has a subrace, and replaces that race's existing subrace options. Alternatively, you can apply this new subrace to a race without subrace options using the modification options provided below.

Your DM might also allow you to take this subrace for a slain character. In that case, your character rises from the dead with its original subrace replaced (or with the necessary modifications made to its base traits), filled with a determination to seek vengeance or complete its mission.

## Contents

* 1 Traits
* 2 Racial Adjustments
  + 2.1 Human Revenant
  + 2.2 Dragonborn Revenant
  + 2.3 Tiefling Revenant

## Traits[]

The following traits replace your subrace's traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
* **Relentless Nature:** Your DM assigns a goal to you — typically, one related to your character's death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:
  + If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.
  + If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.
  + You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

## Racial Adjustments[]

For races that don't have subrace options, taking on the revenant subrace means making changes to your character's base traits, as follows. This article provides options only for human and dragonborn characters. Because half-elves and half-orcs have no subrace options, they shouldn't be used with these revenant subrace rules.

### Human Revenant[]

If you want to play a Human revenant, modify the human's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. If you use the variant human traits, remove the Skills trait and the Feat trait.

### Dragonborn Revenant[]

If you want to play a Dragonborn revenant, modify the dragonborn's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Additionally, your Draconic Ancestry trait uses necrotic damage as its damage type, replacing the damage type that applies to your breath weapon and your damage resistance.

### Tiefling Revenant[]

Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes released several Tiefling variants that make use of subraces. Use the book to make a tiefling revenant, replacing the subrace options with the revenant subrace options.

* If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.
* You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

## Racial Adjustments[]

For races that don't have subrace options, taking on the revenant subrace means making changes to your character's base traits, as follows. This article provides options only for human and dragonborn characters. Because half-elves and half-orcs have no subrace options, they shouldn't be used with these revenant subrace rules.

### Human Revenant[]

If you want to play a Human revenant, modify the human's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. If you use the variant human traits, remove the Skills trait and the Feat trait.

### Dragonborn Revenant[]

If you want to play a Dragonborn revenant, modify the dragonborn's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Additionally, your Draconic Ancestry trait uses necrotic damage as its damage type, replacing the damage type that applies to your breath weapon and your damage resistance.

### Tiefling Revenant[]

Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes released several Tiefling variants that make use of subraces. Use the book to make a tiefling revenant, replacing the subrace options with the revenant subrace options.

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 29)

As a satyr, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

***Ram.*** You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Magic Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against spells.

***Mirthful Leaps.*** Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll one D8 + your dexterity modifier and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as usual.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

***Fey.*** Your creature type is Fey, rather than Humanoid.

# Simic Hybrid

From Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 20; and Unearthed Arcana: Races of Ravnica].

## Contents

* 1 Traits
  + 1.1 Animal Enhancement
* 2 Unearthed Arcana: Races of Ravnica
  + 2.1 Animal Enhancement

## Traits[]

(Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, page 20)

Your Simic hybrid character has the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves, or vedalken. They age at a slightly accelerated rate, so their maximum life spans are probably reduced somewhat. The Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.

***Alignment.*** Most hybrids share the generally neutral outlook of the Simic Combine. They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. Those who leave the Combine, however, often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild's.

***Size.*** Your size is Medium, within the normal range of your humanoid base race.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and your choice of Elvish or Vedalken.

### Animal Enhancement[]

Your body has been altered to incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and a second enhancement at 5th level.

At 1st level, choose one of the following options:

* **Manta Glide.** You have ray-like fins that you can use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.
* **Nimble Climber.** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
* **Underwater Adaptation.** You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level, or one of the following options:

* **Grappling Appendage.** You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.
* **Carapace.** Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.
* **Acid Spit.** As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves, or vedalken. They exhibit signs of slightly accelerated aging, so their maximum lifespans are probably reduced somewhat, but the Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.

***Alignment.*** Most hybrids share the generally neutral outlook of the Simic Combine as a whole. They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. However, those who leave the Combine often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild's.

* **Carapace.** Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.
* **Acid Spit.** As an action, you can spray a stream of acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 33)

As a tabaxi, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Cat's Claws.*** You can use your claws to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Cat's Talent.*** You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Feline Agility.*** Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

## Volo's Guide to Monsters[]

(Volo's Guide to Monsters, page 113; Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 179)

(Astral Adventurer's Guide, page 15)

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Monstrosity.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Chameleon Carapace.*** While you aren't wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Secondary Arms.*** You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property.

***Sleepless.*** You do not require sleep and can remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.

***Thri-kreen Telepathy.*** Without the assistance of magic, you can't speak the non-thri-kreen languages you know. Instead you use telepathy to convey your thoughts. You have the magical ability to transmit your thoughts mentally to willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of yourself. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you to understand your thoughts, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).

# Unearthed Arcana: Travelers of the Multiverse[]

***Creature Type.*** You are a Monstrosity.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

(Player's Handbook, page 42)

Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal descent.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.

***Size.*** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.

***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

***Subrace.*** With your DM's approval, you can choose one of several subraces for your character. These subrace traits replace the Ability Score Increase feature and the Infernal Legacy feature, except the Variant subrace.

### Variant[]

(Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, page 118)

Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.

***Appearance.*** Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4+1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goatlike legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.

***Feral.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait fully replaces the Ability Score Increase trait.

***Devil's Tongue.*** You know the Vicious Mockery cantrip. When your reach 3rd level, you can cast the Charm Person spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Enthrall spell once with this trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells once again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

***Hellfire.*** You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Burning Hands spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

***Winged.*** You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

### Abyssal[]

( Unearthed Arcana: That Old Black Magic])

All abyssal tieflings trace their bloodline to the demons of the Abyss. These tieflings have the following additional features. These features replace the Ability Score Increase, Hellish Resistance, Infernal Legacy, and Languages traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Abyssal Arcana.*** Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd-level spell.

You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-level slot.

At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.

| d6 | 1st-level | 3rd-level | 5th-level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Dancing Lights | Burning Hands | Alter Self |
| 2 | True Strike | Charm Person | Darkness |
| 3 | Light | Magic Missile | Invisibility |
| 4 | Message | Cure Wounds | Levitate |
| 5 | Spare the Dying | Tasha's Hideous Laughter | Mirror Image |
| 6 | Prestidigitation | Thunderwave | Spider Climb |

***Abyssal Fortitude.*** Your hit point maximum increases by half your level (minimum 1).

# Tortle

From The Tortle Package, page 3; and Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 180.

## Traits[]

Your tortle character has the following racial traits.

* **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
* **Age:** Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years.
* **Alignment:** Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.
* **Size:** Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium.

:   In Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, your height is 4'10" with a modifier of +2d8. Your weight is 400 lbs. with a modifier of +(height roll).

* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Claws:** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
* **Hold Breath:** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.
* **Natural Armor:** Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.
* **Shell Defense:** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.
* **Survival Instinct:** You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Vampires don't mature and age in the same way that other races do.

***Alignment.*** Vampires might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, their strict hierarchies incline them toward a lawful alignment.

***Size.*** Vampires are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Most vampires are thus very old, but few have any memory of their earliest years.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Blood Thirst.*** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid killed in this way becomes a null.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Vampire.

# Warforged

From Eberron: Rising From the Last War, page 36; Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, page 69; Unearthed Arcana: Races of Eberron, Unearthed Arcana: Eberron.

A warforged can come in many different shapes and forms. Some more human-like than others.

 

The **Warforged** are a species of sentient, living robotic beings (mostly) originating from the distant world of Eberron

The designation "Warforged" stems from the species' generally-shared ability to war and to reforge their bodies at will, rearranging their component parts from a robotic primary mode (usually, but not always, humanoid) into an alternate form; generally vehicles, weapons, machinery, or animals. In some continuities this ability to transform is innate to all members of the species, in others it was a wartime innovation that was adopted by most, but not all, of the populace.

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 36)

As a yuan-ti, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Magic Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against spells.

***Poison Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself. You also have resistance to poison damage.

***Serpentine Spellcasting.*** You know the Poison Spray cantrip. You can cast Animal Friendship an unlimited number of times with this trait, but you can target only snakes with it. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast Suggestion with this trait. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
