# Aarakocra (Race)

From Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 6; Elemental Evil Player's Companion, page 5; and Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 165.

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 6)

As an aarakocra, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Flight.*** Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Talons.*** You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Wind Caller.*** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Gust of Wind spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast gust of wind with this trait (choose when you select this race).

## Explorer's Guide to Wildemount[]

(Elemental Evil Player's Companion, page 5; Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 165)

As an aarakocra, you have certain traits in common with your people. Being able to fly at high speed starting at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. As a result, playing an aarakocra requires special consideration by your DM.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3. Compared to humans, aarakocra don't usually live longer than 30 years.

***Alignment.*** Most aarakocra are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.

***Size.*** Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall. They have thin, lightweight bodies that weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Talons.*** You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Aarakocra, and Auran.

# Aetherborn

From Plane Shift: Kaladesh, page 17.

## Traits[]

Your aetherborn character has certain traits deriving from your unusual nature.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age.*** Aetherborn come into being as adults and live no more than a few years.

***Alignment.*** As a rule, aetherborn are driven by hedonism and self-interest, making them neutral at best and thoroughly evil at worst. Neutral aetherborn might devote much of their time (and wealth) to parties and social activity, while evil aetherborn are usually involved in the criminal underworld.

***Size.*** Aetherborn are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. They are quite light — only about 100 pounds — and their weight diminishes as they age and more and more of their substance returns to the aethersphere. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Born of Aether.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.

## Gift of the Aetherborn[]

An unknown aetherborn, desperately seeking a means to extend their short life, discovered a process of transformation that prolonged their existence — by giving them the ability to feed on the life essence of other beings. Since then, other aetherborn have learned and carried out this monstrous transformation, and aetherborn with this "gift" have become a small minority among an already small population.

A gifted aetherborn has the ability to drain the life essence of other beings. Similar to the way heat is transferred from a warm object to a cold one, a gifted aetherborn need only touch another living being with a clawed hand to draw life essence out, fueling their own continued existence while draining strength and vitality from their victim.

For many aetherborn, living as they do for indulgence and instant gratification, the concepts of "want" and "need" are virtually synonymous. But Aetherborn with this gift understand what it is to truly need, for they develop a hunger for life essence that far exceeds any desires they might have felt before their transformation. A gifted aetherborn who abstains from this feeding deteriorates even more rapidly than other aetherborn, while enduring unspeakable agony caused by the deprivation of life energy.

At the DM's option, an aetherborn character can research methods of achieving this dark "gift." The process is similar to inventing and manufacturing a rare magic item (see "Inventing and Manufacturing Devices" earlier in this document). But rather than aether, the process requires a variety of rare unguents and unusual ingredients that make up the cost of researching and undergoing the transformation.

An aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability: a natural attack that deals 1d6 necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6 per week. This reduction can't be removed until the aetherborn has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

# Aven

## Contents

* 1 Traits
  + 1.1 Ibis-headed
  + 1.2 Hawk-headed
* 2 Plane Shift: Dominaria

## Traits[]

(Plane Shift: Amonkhet, page 15)

All aven share the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can theoretically live into their 80s. Of course, most find a glorious (or inglorious) death long before that point.

***Alignment.*** Most aven lean toward some form of neutrality. Ibis-headed aven, focused more on knowledge than any other virtue, are usually neutral. Hawk-headed aven are inclined toward lawful neutral.

***Size.*** Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Flying.*** You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.)

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aven.

***Subrace.*** Choose one of two subraces for your character.

### Ibis-headed[]

A majority of ibis-headed aven, drawn to the teachings of Kefnet, specialize in spellcasting. They take great pride in all the qualities they share with the god of knowledge — not just their avian heads, but their quick wit, self-confidence, cunning, and spellcasting prowess.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Kefnet's Blessing.*** You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any Intelligence check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### Hawk-headed[]

Following the example of Oketra, hawk-headed aven often focus on the techniques of long-range combat. Most prefer javelins, but some are skilled with bows, spears, and throwing axes.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2.

***Hawkeyed.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

## Plane Shift: Dominaria[]

(Plane Shift: Dominaria, page 6)

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.

***Age.*** Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can live into their 80s.

***Alignment.*** Aven are inclined toward the lawful good alignment of the Church of Serra.

***Size.*** Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.)

***Hawkeyed.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Aven and Common.
