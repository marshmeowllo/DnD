## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you create a character using a
race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type (the autognome being a noteworthy exception by virtue of its True Life trait).

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries — a fact noted in the description of the race.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 1, your Wisdom score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

Alternatively, you can imprint a creature as your quarry whenever you succeed on a Survival check to track it. When tracking your quarry, double the result of your Intuition die. When your quarry is within 60 feet of you, you have a sense of its location: it can't be hidden from you, gains no benefit from invisibility, and your attacks against it ignore half cover. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Sense Threats.*** When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast Locate Animals or Plants, but only as a ritual.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

# Harengon

From Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 22; The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, page 13; and Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild].

* 3 Creating Your Character
  + 3.1 Ability Score Increases
  + 3.2 Languages

## Traits[]

(Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, page 22; The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, page 13)

As a harengon, you have the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** Your character can read, speak, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. Your DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Hare-Trigger.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

***Leporine Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Lucky Footwork.*** When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success. You can't use this reaction if you're prone or your speed is 0.

***Rabbit Hop.*** As a bonus action, you can jump a number of feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus, without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use this trait only if your speed is greater than 0. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild[]

( Unearthed Arcana: Folk of the Feywild])

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this race.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hare-Trigger.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

***Leporine Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Lucky Footwork.*** When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the result, potentially turning the failure into a success.

***Rabbit Hop.*** Once during each of your turns when you walk at least 5 feet, you can hop, rolling a d12 and moving that many feet in a direction of your choice. This extra distance doesn't cost movement, but you can hop only if your speed isn't 0.

## Creating Your Character[]

At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race such as the harengon, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race in this chapter tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell doesn't work on a Construct or an Undead.

### Lifespan[]

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. Harengons, however, have a life span of about a century.

### Height and Weight[]

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.

***Eerie Token.*** As a bonus action, you can harmlessly remove a lock of hair, one of your nails, or one of your teeth. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can take one of these actions:

* **Telepathic Message.** As an action, you can send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five words.
* **Remote Viewing.** If you are within 10 miles of the token, you can enter a trance as an action. The trance lasts 1 minute, but ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or are incapacitated. During this trance, you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is. While you are using your senses at the token's location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. When the trance ends, the token is harmlessly destroyed.

Once you create a token using this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows.

***Fey Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

***Hex Magic.*** You can cast the Disguise Self and Hex spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spells slots you have.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose the ability when you gain this lineage).

***Fortune from the Many.*** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +3).

## Creating Your Character[]

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you create a character using a race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

### Ability Score Increases[]

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

### Languages[]

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

### Creature Type[]

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the Cure Wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type.

# Hollow One

From Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, pages 181-182.

The Dungeon Master has the option to allow a character created in Wildemount to be a Hollow One. Alternatively, a character who perishes in the course of a campaign might return as a Hollow One, created by the mysterious forces that scar the land.

As a Hollow One, the void left behind by your departed soul is filled with the strange magic of Blightshore. Becoming a Hollow One is a supernatural gift that bestows upon you the following traits.

***Ageless.*** You don't age, and effects that cause you to age don't work.

***Cling to Life.*** When you roll a death saving throw and roll 16 or higher, you regain 1 hit point.

***Revenance.*** You retain your creature type, yet you register as Undead to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the Undead creature type.

***Unsettling Presence.*** As an action, you can unsettle a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes within the next minute. Constructs, Undead, and creatures that can't be frightened are immune to this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Plane Shift: Innistrad[]

(Plane Shift: Innistrad, page 8)

Human characters on Innistrad have the following traits. If you use these human traits, do not use the variant human traits presented in the Player's Handbook. As well, in campaigns that use feats, characters should not be allowed to choose feats that duplicate any provincial traits.

***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment.

***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Innistrad is not a world with a variety of languages, unlike most D&D settings. The people who inhabit the world all speak the same tongue, and the most common monsters — including vampires, werewolves, and geists — speak it as well, since they were once human.

Ordinarily, all humans learn an additional language, and many backgrounds give access to languages as well — so the easiest way to deal with these extra languages is to ignore them. Humans speak only Common. If a background gives access to a language, the character can choose a tool proficiency instead.

***Provincial Origin.*** Choose one of the four provinces of Innistrad as the place of origin for your character.

### Gavony[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

### Kessig[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.

***Fleet of Foot.*** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

***Sure-footed.*** When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.

***Spring Attack.*** When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of your turn, whether you hit or not.

### Nephalia[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence and Charisma scores each increase by 1.

***Breadth of Knowledge.*** You gain proficiency in any combination of four skills or with four tools of your choice.

### Stensia[]

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 1.

***Daunting.*** You have proficiency in the [[Intimidation skill.

***Tough.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 2, and it increases by 2 every time you gain a level.

## Plane Shift: Dominaria[]

(Plane Shift: Dominaria, page 19)

The humans of Keld, also called Keldon, have the following traits, which replace the standard human traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Keldons reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Keldons tend toward chaotic alignments, and many walk a fine line between good and evil.

***Size.*** Keldons are taller and heavier than the human norms of other cultures, standing almost universally above 6 feet tall and reaching heights above 7 feet. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Keldon.
