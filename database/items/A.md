## Item Descriptions[]

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

***Acid.*** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

***Alchemist's Fire.*** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

***Antitoxin.*** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

***Arcane Focus.*** An arcane focus is a special item — an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item — designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.

***Ball Bearings.*** As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

***Block and Tackle.*** A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.

***Book.*** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook.

***Caltrops.*** As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

***Candle.*** For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

***Case, Crossbow Bolt.*** This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.

***Case, Map or Scroll.*** This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.

***Chain.*** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

***Climber's Kit.*** A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

***Component Pouch.*** A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost.

***Crowbar.*** Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.

***Druidic Focus.*** A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.

***Fishing Tackle.*** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.

***Healer's Kit.*** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

***Holy Symbol.*** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Gods lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.

***Holy Water.*** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.

***Hunting Trap.*** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

***Lamp.*** A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

***Lantern, Bullseye.*** A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

***Lantern, Hooded.*** A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

***Lock.*** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

***Magnifying Glass.*** This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

***Manacles.*** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

***Mess Kit.*** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

***Oil.*** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Poison, Basic.*** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

***Potion of Healing.*** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

***Pouch.*** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch.

***Quiver.*** A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.

***Ram, Portable.*** You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

***Rations.*** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

***Rope.*** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

***Scale, Merchant's.*** A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.

***Spellbook.*** Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.

***Spyglass.*** Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.

***Tent.*** A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.

***Tinderbox.*** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch — or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel — takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

***Torch.*** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

# Armor

D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of D&D.

## Contents

* 1 Armor
* 2 Light Armor
* 3 Medium Armor
* 4 Heavy Armor
* 5 Getting Into and Out of Armor
* 6 Rare Materials
  + 6.1 Pride Silk

## Armor[]

| Armor | Cost | AC | Strength | Stealth | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Light Armor* | | | | | |
| Padded | 5 gp | 11 + Dex modifier | — | Disadvantage | 8 lb. |
| Leather | 10 gp | 11 + Dex modifier | — | — | 10 lb. |
| Studded Leather | 45 gp | 12 + Dex modifier | — | — | 13 lb. |
| *Medium Armor* | | | | | |
| Hide | 10 gp | 12 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | — | 12 lb. |
| Chain Shirt | 50 gp | 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | — | 20 lb. |
| Scale Mail | 50 gp | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | Disadvantage | 45 lb. |
| Breastplate | 400 gp | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | — | 20 lb. |
| Half Plate | 750 gp | 15 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | Disadvantage | 40 lb. |
| Spiked Armor | 75 gp | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | Disadvantage | 40 lb. |
| *Heavy Armor* | | | | | |
| Ring Mail | 30 gp | 14 | — | Disadvantage | 40 lb. |
| Chain Mail | 75 gp | 16 | Str 13 | Disadvantage | 55 lb. |
| Splint | 200 gp | 17 | Str 15 | Disadvantage | 60 lb. |
| Plate | 1,500 gp | 18 | Str 15 | Disadvantage | 65 lb. |
| *Shield* | | | | | |
| Shield | 10 gp | +2 | — | — | 6 lb. |

***Armor Proficiency.*** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however.

Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

***Armor Class (AC).*** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

***Heavy Armor.*** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

***Stealth.*** If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Shields.*** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

## Light Armor[]

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

***Padded.*** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

***Leather.*** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

***Studded Leather.*** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

## Medium Armor[]

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

***Hide.*** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.

***Chain Shirt.*** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

***Scale Mail.*** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

***Breastplate.*** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

***Half Plate.*** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.

***Spiked Armor.*** Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.

## Heavy Armor[]

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

***Ring Mail.*** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.

***Chain Mail.*** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

***Splint.*** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

***Plate.*** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

## Getting Into and Out of Armor[]

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

***Don.*** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

***Doff.*** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

| Category | Don | Doff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute |
| Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield | 1 action | 1 action |

## Rare Materials[]

(Dungeon Master's Guide, page 150)

Rare materials used in medium or heavy armors besides hide can add special benefits. While not magical themselves, they are treated with the rarity of such.

Adamantine is one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing adamantine armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

### Pride Silk[]

(Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, page 103)

This hearty silk unique to the Pride's Call region has long been a point of pride with the locals. When processed and woven properly, the resulting cloth is pride silk: an extremely flexible material with the durability of tanned leather. Pride silk has become a favorite cloth for use on military ship sails, war banners, and other utilitarian applications, but has also gained popularity in affluent circles. High-end clothing made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it. The tailors skilled enough to create such outfits are few and far between, so while pride silk might be expensive as a raw material, outfits made of the cloth are prohibitively expensive for most common folk.

One square yard of pride silk weighs 1 pound and costs 100 gp. An outfit made of pride silk weighs 4 pounds and costs 500 gp. If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 11 + your Dexterity modifier while wearing it.
